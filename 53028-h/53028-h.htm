<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I could not say at which station the woman and her
baby entered the train.</p>
<p class="par">Since we had left London I had been engrossed in Henri
Bergson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Time and Free Will,&rdquo; as it is called in
the English translation. I had been conscious of various stoppages and
changes of passengers, but my attention had been held by
Bergson&rsquo;s argument. I agreed with his conclusion in advance, but
I wished to master his reasoning.</p>
<p class="par">I looked up when the woman entered my compartment,
though I did not notice the name of the station. I caught sight of the
baby she was carrying, and turned back to my book. I thought the child
was a freak, an abnormality; and such things disgust me.</p>
<p class="par">I returned to the study of my Bergson and read:
&ldquo;It is at the great and solemn crisis, decisive <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>of our
reputation with others, that we choose in defiance of what is
conventionally called a motive, and this absence of any tangible reason
is the more striking the deeper our freedom goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I kept my eyes on the book&mdash;the train had started
again&mdash;but the next passage conveyed no meaning to my mind, and as
I attempted to re-read it an impression was interposed between me and
the work I was studying.</p>
<p class="par">I saw projected on the page before me an image which I
mistook at first for the likeness of Richard Owen. It was the
conformation of the head that gave rise to the mistake, a head domed
and massive, white and smooth&mdash;it was a head that had always
interested me. But as I looked, my mind already searching for the
reason of this hallucination, I saw that the lower part of the face was
that of an infant. My eyes wandered from the book, and my gaze
fluttered along the four persons seated opposite to me, till they
rested on the reality of my vision. Even as these acts were being
performed, I found myself foolishly saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call
this freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For several seconds the eyes of the infant held mine.
Its gaze was steady and clear as that of a normal child, but what
differentiated it was the impression one received of calm intelligence.
The head was completely bald, and there was no trace <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>of eyebrows,
but the eyes themselves were protected by thick, short lashes.</p>
<p class="par">The child turned its head, and I felt my muscles relax.
Until then I had not been conscious that they had been stiffened. My
gaze was released, pushed aside as it were, and I found myself watching
the object of the child&rsquo;s next scrutiny.</p>
<p class="par">This object was a man of forty or so, inclined to
corpulence, and untidy. He bore the evidences of failure in the process
of becoming. He wore a beard that was scanty and ragged, there were
bare patches of skin on the jaw; one inferred that he wore that beard
only to save the trouble of shaving. He was sitting next to me, the
middle passenger of the three on my side of the carriage, and he was
absorbed in the pages of a half-penny paper&mdash;I think he was
reading the Police News&mdash;which was interposed between him and the
child in the corner diagonally opposite to that which I occupied.</p>
<p class="par">The man was hunched up, slouching, his legs crossed, his
elbows seeking support against his body; he held with both hands his
paper, unfolded, close to his eyes. He had the appearance of being very
myopic, but he did not wear glasses.</p>
<p class="par">As I watched him, he began to fidget. He uncrossed his
legs and hunched his body deeper into the back of his seat. Presently
his eyes began <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>to creep up the paper in front of him. When they
reached the top, he hesitated a moment, making a survey under cover,
then he dropped his hands and stared stupidly at the infant in the
corner, his mouth slightly open, his feet pulled in under the seat of
the carriage.</p>
<p class="par">As the child let him go, his head drooped, and then he
turned and looked at me with a silly, vacuous smile. I looked away
hurriedly; this was not a man with whom I cared to share
experience.</p>
<p class="par">The process was repeated. The next victim was a big,
rubicund, healthy-looking man, clean shaved, with light-blue eyes that
were slightly magnified by the glasses of his gold-mounted spectacles.
He, too, had been reading a newspaper&mdash;the <i>Evening
Standard</i>&mdash;until the child&rsquo;s gaze claimed his attention,
and he, too, was held motionless by that strange, appraising stare. But
when he was released, his surprise found vent in words.
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;is the man accustomed to
act.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A very remarkable child, ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; he
said, addressing the thin, ascetic-looking mother.</p>

<p class="par first">The mother&rsquo;s appearance did not convey the
impression of poverty. She was, indeed, warmly, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>decently,
and becomingly clad. She wore a long black coat, braided and frogged;
it had the air of belonging to an older fashion, but the material of it
was new. And her bonnet, trimmed with jet ornaments growing on stalks
that waved tremulously&mdash;that, also, was a modern replica of an
older mode. On her hands were black thread gloves, somewhat
ill-fitting.</p>
<p class="par">Her face was not that of a country woman. The thin,
high-bridged nose, the fallen cheeks, the shadows under eyes gloomy and
retrospective&mdash;these were marks of the town; above all, perhaps,
that sallow greyness of the skin which speaks of confinement....</p>
<p class="par">The child looked healthy enough. Its great bald head
shone resplendently like a globe of alabaster.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A very remarkable child, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
the rubicund man who sat facing the woman.</p>
<p class="par">The woman twitched her untidy-looking black eyebrows,
her head trembled slightly and set the jet fruit of her bonnet dancing
and nodding.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very remarkable,&rdquo; said the man, adjusting
his spectacles and leaning forward. His action had an air of deliberate
courage; he was justifying his fortitude after that temporary
aberration.</p>
<p class="par">I watched him a little nervously. I remembered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>my feelings when, as a child, I had seen some
magnificent enter the lion&rsquo;s den in a travelling circus. The
failure on my right was, also, absorbed in the spectacle; he stared,
open-mouthed, his eyes blinking and shifting.</p>
<p class="par">The other three occupants of the compartment, sitting on
the same side as the woman, back to the engine, dropped papers and
magazines and turned their heads, all interest. None of these three
had, so far as I had observed, fallen under the spell of inspection by
the infant, but I noticed that the man&mdash;an artisan
apparently&mdash;who sat next to the woman had edged away from her, and
that the three passengers opposite to me were huddled towards my end of
the compartment.</p>
<p class="par">The child had abstracted its gaze, which was now
directed down the aisle of the carriage, indefinitely focussed on some
point outside the window. It seemed remote, entirely unconcerned with
any human being.</p>
<p class="par">I speak of it asexually. I was still uncertain as to its
sex. It is true that all babies look alike to me; but I should have
known that this child was male, the conformation of the skull alone
should have told me that. It was its dress that gave me cause to
hesitate. It was dressed absurdly, not in &ldquo;long-clothes,&rdquo;
but in a long frock that hid its feet and was bunched about its body.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Er&mdash;does it&mdash;er&mdash;can
it&mdash;talk?&rdquo; hesitated the rubicund man, and I grew hot at his
boldness. There seemed to be something disrespectful in speaking before
the child in this impersonal way.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir, he&rsquo;s never made a sound,&rdquo;
replied the woman, twitching and vibrating. Her heavy, dark eyebrows
jerked spasmodically, nervously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Never cried?&rdquo; persisted the
interrogator.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Never once, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dumb, eh?&rdquo; He said it as an aside, half
under his breath.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s never spoke, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; The man cleared his throat and braced
himself with a deliberate and obvious effort. &ldquo;Is
it&mdash;he&mdash;not water on the brain&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I felt that a rigour of breathless suspense held every
occupant of the compartment. I wanted, and I know that every other
person there wanted, to say, &ldquo;Look out! Don&rsquo;t go too
far.&rdquo; The child, however, seemed unconscious of the insult: he
still stared out through the window, lost in profound
contemplation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir, oh no!&rdquo; replied the woman.
&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s got more sense than a ordinary child.&rdquo;
She held the infant as if it were some priceless piece of earthenware,
not nursing it as a woman nurses a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10"
href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>baby, but balancing it with
supreme attention in her lap.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">We had been awaiting this question.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A year and nine munse, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ought to have spoken before that, oughtn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Never even cried, sir,&rdquo; said the woman. She
regarded the child with a look into which I read something of
apprehension. If it were apprehension it was a feeling that we all
shared. But the rubicund man was magnificent, though, like the lion
tamer of my youthful experience, he was doubtless conscious of the
aspect his temerity wore in the eyes of beholders. He must have been
showing off.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you taken opinion?&rdquo; he asked; and
then, seeing the woman&rsquo;s lack of comprehension, he translated the
question&mdash;badly, for he conveyed a different
meaning&mdash;thus,</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I mean, have you had a doctor for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The train was slackening speed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And what do <i>they</i> say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The child turned its head and looked the rubicund man
full in the eyes. Never in the face of any man or woman have I seen
such an expression of sublime pity and contempt....</p>
<p class="par">I remembered a small urchin I had once seen at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>the Zoological Gardens. Urged on by a band of
other urchins, he was throwing pebbles at a great lion that lolled,
finely indifferent, on the floor of its playground. Closer crept the
urchin; he grew splendidly bold; he threw larger and larger pebbles,
until the lion rose suddenly with a roar, and dashed fiercely down to
the bars of its cage.</p>
<p class="par">I thought of that urchin&rsquo;s scared, shrieking face
now, as the rubicund man leant quickly back into his corner.</p>
<p class="par">Yet that was not all, for the infant, satisfied,
perhaps, with its victim&rsquo;s ignominy, turned and looked at me with
a cynical smile. I was, as it were, taken into its confidence. I felt
flattered, undeservedly yet enormously flattered. I blushed, I may have
simpered.</p>
<p class="par">The train drew up in Great Hittenden station.</p>
<p class="par">The woman gathered her priceless possession carefully
into her arms, and the rubicund man adroitly opened the door for
her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good day, sir,&rdquo; she said, as she got
out.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; echoed the rubicund man with
relief, and we all drew a deep breath of relief with him in concert, as
though we had just witnessed the safe descent of some over-daring
aviator. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As the train moved on, we six, who had been
fellow-passengers for some thirty or forty minutes before the woman had
entered our compartment, we who had not till then exchanged a word,
broke suddenly into general conversation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Water on the brain; I don&rsquo;t care what any
one says,&rdquo; asserted the rubicund man.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My sister had one very similar&rdquo;, put in the
failure, who was sitting next to me. &ldquo;It died,&rdquo; he added,
by way of giving point to his instance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ought not to exhibit freaks like that in
public,&rdquo; said an old man opposite to me.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, sir,&rdquo; was the verdict
of the artisan, and he spat carefully and scraped his boot on the
floor; &ldquo;them things ought to be kep&rsquo; private.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mad, of course, that&rsquo;s to say
imbecile&rdquo;, repeated the rubicund man.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Horrid head he&rsquo;d got,&rdquo; said the
failure, and shivered histrionically.</p>
<p class="par">They continued to demonstrate their contempt for the
infant by many asseverations. The reaction grew. They were all bold now
and all wanted to speak. They spoke as the survivors from some common
peril; they were increasingly anxious to demonstrate that they had
never suffered intimidation and in their relief they were anxious to
laugh <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>at the thing which had for a time subdued them.
But they never named it as a cause for fear. Their speech was merely
innuendo.</p>
<p class="par">At the last, however, I caught an echo of the true
feeling.</p>
<p class="par">It was the rubicund man, who, most daring during the
crisis was now bold enough to admit curiosity.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your opinion, sir?&rdquo; he said to
me. The train was running into Wenderby; he was preparing to get out;
and he leaned forward, his fingers on the handle of the door.</p>
<p class="par">I was embarrassed. Why had I been singled out by the
child? I had taken no part in the recent interjectory conversation. Was
this a consequence of the notice that had been paid to me?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I?&rdquo; I stammered and then reverted to the
rubicund man&rsquo;s original phrase, &ldquo;It&mdash;it was certainly
a very remarkable child,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="par">The rubicund man nodded and pursed his lips.
&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; he muttered as he alighted, &ldquo;Very remarkable.
Well, good day to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I returned to my book and was surprised to find that my
index finger was still marking the place at which I had been
interrupted some fifteen minutes before. My arm felt stiff and
cramped.</p>
<p class="par">I read &ldquo;... this absence of any tangible reason is
the more striking the deeper our freedom goes.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="main">NOTES FOR A BIOGRAPHY OF GINGER STOTT</h2>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">I</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ginger Stott is a name that was once as well known
as any in England. Stott has been the subject of leading articles in
every daily paper; his life has been written by an able journalist who
interviewed Stott himself, during ten crowded minutes, and filled three
hundred pages with details, seventy per cent. of which were taken from
the journals, and the remainder supplied by a brilliant imagination.
Ten years ago Ginger Stott was on a pinnacle, there was a Stott vogue.
You found his name at the bottom of signed articles written by members
of the editorial staff; you bought Stott collars, although Stott
himself did not wear collars; there was a Stott waltz which is
occasionally hummed by clerks, and whistled by errand-boys to this day;
there was a periodical which lived for ten months, entitled <i>Ginger
Stott&rsquo;s Weekly</i>; in brief, during one summer there was a Stott
apotheosis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But that was ten years ago, and the rising generation
has almost forgotten the once well-known name. One rarely sees him
mentioned in the morning paper now, and then it is but the briefest
reference; some such note as this &ldquo;Pickering was at the top of
his form, recalling the finest achievements of Ginger Stott at his
best,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Flack is a magnificent find for Kent: he
promises to completely surpass the historic feats of Ginger
Stott.&rdquo; These journalistic superlatives only irritate those who
remember the performances referred to. We who watched the man&rsquo;s
career know that Pickering and Flack are but tyros compared to Stott;
we know that none of his successors has challenged comparison with him.
He was a meteor that blazed across the sky, and if he ever has a true
successor, such stars as Pickering and Flack will shine pale and dim in
comparison.</p>
<p class="par">It makes one feel suddenly old to recall that great
matin&eacute;e at the Lyceum, given for Ginger Stott&rsquo;s benefit
after he met with his accident. In ten years so many great figures in
that world have died or fallen into obscurity. I can count on my
fingers the number of those who were then, and are still, in the
forefront of popularity. Of the others poor Captain Wallis, for
instance, is dead&mdash;and no modern writer, in my opinion, can equal
the brilliant descriptiveness of Wallis&rsquo;s articles in the
<i>Daily Post</i>. Bobby Maisefield, again, Stott&rsquo;s colleague, is
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>martyr to rheumatism, and keeps a shop in
Ailesworth, the scene of so many of his triumphs. What a list one might
make, but how uselessly. It is enough to note how many names have
dropped out, how many others are the names of those we now speak of as
veterans. In ten years! It certainly makes one feel old.</p>

<p class="par first">No apology is needed for telling again the story
of Stott&rsquo;s career. Certain details will still be familiar, it is
true, the historic details that can never be forgotten while cricket
holds place as our national game. But there are many facts of
Stott&rsquo;s life familiar to me, which have never been made public
property. If I must repeat that which is known, I can give the known a
new setting; perhaps a new value.</p>
<p class="par">He came of mixed races. His mother was pure Welsh, his
father a Yorkshire collier; but when Ginger was nine years old his
father died, and Mrs. Stott came to live in Ailesworth where she had
immigrant relations, and it was there that she set up the little
paper-shop, the business by which she maintained herself and her boy.
That shop is still in existence, and the name has not been altered. You
may find it in the little street <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17"
href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>that runs off the market place,
going down towards the Borstal Institution.</p>
<p class="par">There are many people alive in Ailesworth today who can
remember the sturdy, freckled, sandy-haired boy who used to go round
with the morning and evening papers; the boy who was to change the
fortunes of a county.</p>
<p class="par">Ginger was phenomenally thorough in all he undertook. It
was one of the secrets of his success. It was this thoroughness that
kept him engaged in his mother&rsquo;s little business until he was
seventeen. Up to that age he never found time for cricket&mdash;he
certainly had remarkable and very unusual qualities.</p>
<p class="par">It was sheer chance, apparently, that determined his
choice of a career.</p>
<p class="par">He had walked into Stoke-Underhill to deliver a parcel,
and on his way back his attention was arrested by the sight of a line
of vehicles drawn up to the boarded fencing that encloses the
Ailesworth County Ground. The occupants of these vehicles were standing
up, struggling to catch a sight of the match that was being played
behind the screen erected to shut out non-paying sightseers. Among the
horses&rsquo; feet, squirming between the spokes of wheels, utterly
regardless of all injury, small boys glued their eyes to knot-holes in
the fence, while others climbed surreptitiously, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>for the
most part unobserved, on to the backs of tradesmen&rsquo;s carts. All
these individuals were in a state of tremendous excitement, and even
the policeman whose duty it was to move them on, was so engrossed in
watching the game that he had disappeared inside the turnstile, and had
given the outside spectators full opportunity for eleemosynary
enjoyment.</p>
<p class="par">That tarred fence has since been raised some six feet,
and now encloses a wider sweep of ground&mdash;alterations that may be
classed among the minor revolutions effected by the genius of that
thick-set, fair-haired youth of seventeen, who paused on that early
September afternoon to wonder what all the fuss was about. The
Ailesworth County Ground was not famous in those days; not then was
accommodation needed for thirty thousand spectators, drawn from every
county in England to witness the unparalleled.</p>
<p class="par">Ginger stopped. The interest of the spectacle pierced
his absorption in the business he had in hand. Such a thing was almost
unprecedented.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he asked of Puggy
Phillips.</p>
<p class="par">Puggy Phillips&mdash;hazarding his life by standing on
the shiny, slightly curved top of his butcher&rsquo;s cart&mdash;made
no appropriate answer. &ldquo;Yah&mdash;<i>ah</i>&mdash;<span class=
"sc">AH</span>!&rdquo; he screamed in ecstasy. &ldquo;Oh! played!
Pla-a-a-ayed!!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19"
name="pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Ginger wasted no more breath, but laid hold of the
little brass rail that encircled Puggy&rsquo;s platform, and with a
sudden hoist that lifted the shafts and startled the pony, raised
himself to the level of a spectator.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere!&rdquo; shouted the swaying, tottering
Puggy, &ldquo;What the ... are yer rup to?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The well-drilled pony, however, settled down again
quietly to maintain his end of the see-saw, and, finding himself still
able to preserve his equilibrium, Puggy instantly forgot the presence
of the intruder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Ginger again.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! Well <i>&rsquo;it</i>, <span class="sc">WELL
&rsquo;IT</span>!&rdquo; yelled Puggy. &ldquo;Oh! Gow on, gow on agen!
Run it <i>aht</i>. Run it <span class="sc">AH-T</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ginger gave it up, and turned his attention to the
match.</p>
<p class="par">It was not any famous struggle that was being fought out
on the old Ailesworth Ground; it was only second-class cricket, the
deciding match of the Minor Counties championship. Hampdenshire and
Oxfordshire, old rivals, had been neck-and-neck all through the season,
and, as luck would have it, the engagement between them had been the
last fixture on the card.</p>
<p class="par">When Ginger rose to the level of spectator, the match
was anybody&rsquo;s game. Bobby Maisefield <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>was
batting. He was then a promising young colt who had not earned a fixed
place in the Eleven. Ginger knew him socially, but they were not
friends, they had no interests in common. Bobby had made twenty-seven.
He was partnered by old Trigson, the bowler, (he has been dead these
eight years,) whose characteristic score of &ldquo;Not out ...
O,&rdquo; is sufficiently representative of his methods.</p>
<p class="par">It was the fourth innings, and Hampdenshire with only
one more wicket to fall, still required nineteen runs to win. Trigson
could be relied upon to keep his wicket up, but not to score. The hopes
of Ailesworth centred in the ability of that almost untried colt Bobby
Maisefield&mdash;and he seemed likely to justify the trust reposed in
him. A beautiful late cut that eluded third man and hit the fence with
a resounding bang, nearly drove Puggy wild with delight.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Only fifteen more,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Oh!
Played; pla-a-a-yed!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But as the score crept up, the tensity grew. As each
ball was delivered, a chill, rigid silence held the onlookers in its
grip. When Trigson, with the field collected round him, almost to be
covered with a sheet, stonewalled the most tempting lob, the click of
the ball on his bat was an intrusion on the stillness. And always it
was followed by a deep breath of relief that sighed round the ring
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>like a faint wind through a plantation of larches.
When Bobby scored, the tumult broke out like a crash of thunder; but it
subsided again, echoless, to that intense silence so soon as the ball
was &ldquo;dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Curiously, it was not Bobby who made the winning hit but
Trigson. &ldquo;One to tie, two to win,&rdquo; breathed Puggy as the
field changed over, and it was Trigson who had to face the bowling. The
suspense was torture. Oxford had put on their fast bowler again, and
Trigson, intimidated, perhaps, did not play him with quite so straight
a bat as he had opposed to the lob-bowler. The ball hit Trigson&rsquo;s
bat and glanced through the slips. The field was very close to the
wicket, and the ball was travelling fast. No one seemed to make any
attempt to stop it. For a moment the significance of the thing was not
realised; for a moment only, then followed uproar, deafening,
stupendous.</p>
<p class="par">Puggy was stamping fiercely on the top of his cart; the
tears were streaming down his face; he was screaming and yelling
incoherent words. He was representative of the crowd. Thus men shouted
and stamped and cried when news came of the relief of Kimberley, or
when that false report of victory was brought to Paris in the August of
1870....</p>
<p class="par">The effect upon Ginger was a thing apart. He did not
join in the fierce acclamation; he did not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>wait to
see the chairing of Bobby and Trigson. The greatness of Stott&rsquo;s
character, the fineness of his genius is displayed in his attitude
towards the dramatic spectacle he had just witnessed.</p>
<p class="par">As he trudged home into Ailesworth, his thoughts found
vent in a muttered sentence which is peculiarly typical of the effect
that had been made upon him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I believe I could have bowled that chap,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p class="par first">In writing a history of this kind, a certain
licence must be claimed. It will be understood that I am filling
certain gaps in the narrative with imagined detail. But the facts are
true. My added detail is only intended to give an appearance of life
and reality to my history. Let me, therefore, insist upon one vital
point. I have not been dependent on hearsay for one single fact in this
story. Where my experience does not depend upon personal experience, it
has been received from the principals themselves. Finally, it should be
remembered that when I have, imaginatively, put words into the mouths
of the persons of this story, they are never essential words which
affect the issue. The essential speeches are reported from first-hand
sources. For instance, Ginger Stott himself has told me on more than
one occasion that the words <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>with which I closed the last section,
were the actual words spoken by him on the occasion in question. It was
not until six years after the great Oxfordshire match that I myself
first met the man, but what follows is literally true in all
essentials.</p>
<p class="par">There was a long, narrow strip of yard, or alley, at the
back of Mrs. Stott&rsquo;s paper-shop, a yard that, unfortunately, no
longer exists. It has been partly built over, and another of
England&rsquo;s memorials has thus been destroyed by the vandals of
modern commerce....</p>
<p class="par">This yard was fifty-three feet long, measuring from Mrs.
Stott&rsquo;s back door to the door of the coal-shed, which marked the
alley&rsquo;s extreme limit. This measurement, an apparently negligible
trifle, had an important effect upon Stott&rsquo;s career. For it was
in this yard that he taught himself to bowl, and the shortness of the
pitch precluded his taking any run. From those long studious hours of
practice he emerged with a characteristic that was&mdash;and still
remains&mdash;unique. Stott never took more than two steps before
delivering the ball; frequently he bowled from a standing position, and
batsmen have confessed that of all Stott&rsquo;s puzzling mannerisms,
this was the one to which they never became accustomed. S. R. L.
Maturin, the finest bat Australia ever sent to this country, has told
me that to this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>peculiarity of delivery he attributed his failure
ever to score freely against Stott. It completely upset one&rsquo;s
habit of play, he said: one had no time to prepare for the flight of
the ball; it came at one so suddenly. Other bowlers have since
attempted some imitation of this method without success. They had not
Stott&rsquo;s physical advantages.</p>
<p class="par">Nevertheless, the shortness of that alley threw Stott
back for two years. When he first emerged to try conclusions on the
field, he found his length on the longer pitch utterly unreliable, and
the effort necessary to throw the ball another six yards, at first
upset his slowly acquired methods.</p>
<p class="par">It was not until he was twenty years old that Ginger
Stott played in his first Colts&rsquo; match.</p>
<p class="par">The three years that had intervened had not been
prosperous years for Hampdenshire. Their team was a one-man team. Bobby
Maisefield was developing into a fine bat (and other counties were
throwing out inducements to him, trying to persuade him to qualify for
first-class cricket), but he found no support, and Hampdenshire was
never looked upon as a coming county. The best of the minor counties in
those years were Staffordshire and Norfolk.</p>
<p class="par">In the Colts&rsquo; match Stott&rsquo;s analysis
ran:</p>
<div class="table">
<table class="xd22e730">

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">and reference to the score-sheet, which is still
preserved <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>among the records of the County Club, shows that
six of the seven wickets were clean bowled. The Eleven had no second
innings; the match was drawn, owing to rain. Stott has told me that the
Eleven had to bat on a drying wicket, but after making all allowances,
the performance was certainly phenomenal.</p>
<p class="par">After this match Stott was, of course, played regularly.
That year Hampdenshire rose once more to their old position at the head
of the minor counties, and Maisefield, who had been seriously
considering Surrey&rsquo;s offer of a place in their Eleven after two
years&rsquo; qualification by residence, decided to remain with the
county which had given him his first chance.</p>
<p class="par">During that season Stott did not record any performance
so remarkable as his feat in the Colts&rsquo; match, but his record for
the year was eighty-seven wickets with an average of 9.31; and it is
worthy of notice that Yorkshire made overtures to him, as he was
qualified by birth to play for the northern county.</p>
<p class="par">I think there must have been a wonderful <i lang=
"fr">esprit de corps</i> among the members of that early Hampdenshire
Eleven. There are other evidences beside this refusal of its two most
prominent members to join the ranks of first-class cricket. Lord
R&mdash;&mdash;, the president of the H.C.C.C<span class="corr" id=
"xd22e764" title="Not in source">.</span>, has told me that this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>spirit was quite as marked as in the earlier case
of Kent. He himself certainly did much to promote it, and his
generosity in making good the deficits of the balance sheet, had a
great influence on the acceleration of Hampdenshire&rsquo;s
triumph.</p>
<p class="par">In his second year, though Hampdenshire were again
champions of the second-class counties, Stott had not such a fine
average as in the preceding season. Sixty-one wickets for eight hundred
and sixty-eight (average 14.23) seems to show a decline in his powers,
but that was a wonderful year for batsmen (Maisefield scored seven
hundred and forty-two runs, with an average of forty-two) and,
moreover, that was the year in which Stott was privately practising his
new theory.</p>
<p class="par">It was in this year that three very promising recruits,
all since become famous, joined the Eleven, viz.: P. H. Evans, St. John
Townley, and Flower the fast bowler. With these five cricketers
Hampdenshire fully deserved their elevation into the list of
first-class counties. Curiously enough, they took the place of the old
champions, Gloucestershire, who, with Somerset, fell back into the
obscurity of the second-class that season. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I must turn aside for a moment at this point in
order to explain the &ldquo;new theory&rdquo; of Stott&rsquo;s, to
which I have referred, a theory which became in practice one of the
elements of his most astounding successes.</p>
<p class="par">Ginger Stott was not a tall man. He stood only 5 ft.
5&frac14; in. in his socks, but he was tremendously solid; he had what
is known as a &ldquo;stocky&rdquo; figure, broad and deep-chested. That
was where his muscular power lay, for his abnormally long arms were
rather thin, though his huge hands were powerful enough.</p>
<p class="par">Even without his &ldquo;new theory,&rdquo; Stott would
have been an exceptional bowler. His thoroughness would have assured
his success. He studied his art diligently, and practised regularly in
a barn through the winter. His physique, too, was a magnificent
instrument. That long, muscular body was superbly steady on the short,
thick legs. It gave him a fulcrum, firm, apparently immovable. And
those weirdly long, thin arms could move with lightning rapidity. He
always stood with his hands behind him, and then&mdash;as often as not
without even one preliminary step&mdash;the long arm would flash round
and the ball be delivered, without giving the batsman any opportunity
of watching his hand; you could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28"
href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>never tell which way he was
going to break. It was astonishing, too, the pace he could get without
any run. Poor Wallis used to call him the &ldquo;human catapult&rdquo;;
Wallis was always trying to find new phrases.</p>
<p class="par">The theory first came to Stott when he was practising at
the nets. It was a windy morning, and he noticed that several times the
balls he bowled swerved in the air. When those swerving balls came they
were almost unplayable.</p>
<p class="par">Stott made no remark to any one&mdash;he was bowling to
the groundsman&mdash;but the ambition to bowl &ldquo;swerves,&rdquo; as
they were afterwards called, took possession of him from that morning.
It is true that he never mastered the theory completely; on a perfectly
calm day he could never depend upon obtaining any swerve at all, but,
within limits, he developed his theory until he had any batsman
practically at his mercy.</p>
<p class="par">He might have mastered the theory completely, had it not
been for his accident&mdash;we must remember that he had only three
seasons of first-class cricket&mdash;and, personally, I believe he
would have achieved that complete mastery. But I do not believe, as
Stott did, that he could have taught his method to another man. That
belief became an obsession with him, and will be dealt with later.</p>
<p class="par">My own reasons for doubting that Stott&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>&ldquo;swerve&rdquo; could have been taught, is
that it would have been necessary for the pupil to have had
Stott&rsquo;s peculiarities, not only of method, but of physique. He
used to spin the ball with a twist of his middle finger and
thumb,&mdash;just as you may see a billiard professional spin a
billiard ball. To do this in his manner, it is absolutely necessary not
only to have a very large and muscular hand, but to have very lithe and
flexible arm muscles, for the arm is moving rapidly while the twist is
given, and there must be no antagonistic muscular action. Further, I
believe that part of the secret was due to the fact that Stott bowled
from a standing position. Given these things, the rest is merely a
question of long and assiduous practice. The human mechanism is
marvellously adaptable. I have seen Stott throw a cricket ball half
across the room with sufficient spin on the ball to make it shoot back
to him along the carpet.</p>
<p class="par">I have mentioned the wind as a factor in obtaining the
swerve. It was a head-wind that Stott required. I have seen him, for
sport, toss a cricket ball into the teeth of a gale, and make it
describe the trajectory of a badly sliced golf-ball. This is why the
big pavilion at Ailesworth is set at such a curious angle to the
ground. It was built in the winter following Hampdenshire&rsquo;s
second season of first-class cricket, and it was so placed that when
the wickets were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>pitched in a line with it, they might lie
south-west and north-east, or in the direction of the prevailing
winds.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The first time I ever saw Ginger Stott, was on the
occasion of the historic encounter with Surrey; Hampdenshire&rsquo;s
second engagement in first-class cricket. The match with Notts, played
at Trent Bridge a few days earlier, had not foreshadowed any startling
results. The truth of the matter is that Stott had been kept,
deliberately, in the background; and as matters turned out his services
were only required to finish off Notts&rsquo; second innings. Stott was
even then a marked man, and the Hampdenshire captain did not wish to
advertise his methods too freely before the Surrey match. Neither
Archie Findlater, who was captaining the team that year, nor any other
person, had the least conception of how unnecessary such a reservation
was to prove. In his third year, when Stott had been studied by every
English, Australian, and South African batsman of any note, he was
still as unplayable as when he made his d&eacute;but in first-class
cricket.</p>
<p class="par">I was reporting the Surrey match for two papers, and in
company with poor Wallis interviewed Stott before the first
innings.</p>
<p class="par">His appearance made a great impression on me.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>I have, of course, met him, and talked with him
many times since then, but my most vivid memory of him is the picture
recorded in the inadequate professional dressing-room of the old
Ailesworth pavilion.</p>
<p class="par">I have turned up the account of my interview in an old
press-cutting book, and I do not know that I can do better than quote
that part of it which describes Stott&rsquo;s personal appearance. I
wrote the account on the off chance of being able to get it taken. It
was one of my lucky hits. After that match, finished in a single day,
my interview afforded copy that any paper would have paid heavily for,
and gladly.</p>
<p class="par">Here is the description:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Stott&mdash;he is known to every one in
Ailesworth as &lsquo;Ginger&rsquo; Stott&mdash;is a short, thick-set
young man, with abnormally long arms that are tanned a rich red up to
the elbow. The tan does not, however, obliterate the golden freckles
with which arm and face are richly speckled. There is no need to
speculate as to the <i lang="fr">raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of his
nickname. The hair of his head, a close, short crop, is a pale russet,
and the hair on his hands and arms is a yellower shade of the same
colour. &lsquo;Ginger&rsquo; is, indeed, a perfectly apt description.
He has a square chin and a thin-lipped, determined mouth. His eyes are
a clear, but rather light blue, his forehead is good, broad, and high,
and he has a well-proportioned head. One might have put him down as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>an engineer, essentially intelligent, purposeful,
and reserved.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The description is journalistic, but I do not know that
I could improve upon the detail of it. I can see those queer, freckled,
hairy arms of his as I write&mdash;the combination of colours in them
produced an effect that was almost orange. It struck one as
unusual....</p>
<p class="par">Surrey had the choice of innings, and decided to bat,
despite the fact that the wicket was drying after rain, under the
influence of a steady south-west wind and occasional bursts of
sunshine. Would any captain in Stott&rsquo;s second year have dared to
take first innings under such conditions? The question is farcical now,
but not a single member of the Hampdenshire Eleven had the least
conception that the Surrey captain was deliberately throwing away his
chances on that eventful day.</p>
<p class="par">Wallis and I were sitting together in the
reporters&rsquo; box. There were only four of us; two
specials,&mdash;Wallis and myself,&mdash;a news-agency reporter, and a
local man.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Stott takes first over,&rdquo; remarked Wallis,
sharpening his pencil and arranging his watch and score-sheet&mdash;he
was very meticulous in his methods. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve put him to
bowl against the wind. He&rsquo;s medium right, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;He volunteered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span>no information; Hampdenshire have been
keeping him dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Wallis sneered. &ldquo;Think they&rsquo;ve got a find,
eh?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait and see what he can do
against first-class batting.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">We did not have to wait long.</p>
<p class="par">As usual, Thorpe and Harrison were first wicket for
Surrey, and Thorpe took the first ball.</p>
<p class="par">It bowled him. It made his wicket look as untidy as any
wicket I have ever seen. The off stump was out of the ground, and the
other two were markedly divergent.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Damn it, I wasn&rsquo;t ready for him,&rdquo; we
heard Thorpe say in the professionals&rsquo; room. Thorpe always had
some excuse, but on this occasion it was justified.</p>
<p class="par">C. V. Punshon was the next comer, and he got his first
ball through the slips for four, but Wallis looked at me with a raised
eyebrow.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Punshon didn&rsquo;t know a lot about
that,&rdquo; he said, and then he added, &ldquo;I say, what a queer
delivery the chap has. He stands and shoots &rsquo;em out. It&rsquo;s
uncanny. He&rsquo;s a kind of human catapult.&rdquo; He made a note of
the phrase on his pad.</p>
<p class="par">Punshon succeeded in hitting the next ball, also, but it
simply ran up his bat into the hands of short slip.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a sitter, if you like,&rdquo;
said Wallis. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">I was beginning to grow enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look here, Wallis,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this
chap&rsquo;s going to break records.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Wallis was still doubtful.</p>
<p class="par">He was convinced before the innings was over.</p>
<p class="par">There must be many who remember the startling poster
that heralded the early editions of the evening papers:</p>
<p class="par xd22e123">SURREY<br>

<p class="par">For once sub-editors did not hesitate to give the score
on the contents bill. That was a proclamation which would sell. Inside,
the headlines were rich and varied. I have an old paper by me, yellow
now, and brittle, that may serve as a type for the rest. The headlines
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">The &ldquo;double hat-trick&rdquo; was six consecutive
wickets, the last six, all clean bowled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; Wallis said, when the last
wicket fell, and he looked at me with something like fear in his eyes.
&ldquo;This man will have to be barred; it means the end of
cricket.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I need not detail the remainder of the match.
Hampdenshire hit up ninety-three&mdash;P. H. Evans was top scorer with
twenty-seven&mdash;and then got Surrey out a second time for
forty-nine.</p>
<p class="par">I believe Stott did not bowl his best in the second
innings. He was quite clever enough to see that he must not overdo it.
As Wallis had said, if he were too effective he might have to be
barred. As it was, he took seven wickets for twenty-three.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">VI</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">That was Stott&rsquo;s finest performance. On
eight subsequent occasions he took all ten wickets in a single innings,
once he took nineteen wickets in one match (Hampdenshire <i>v.</i>
Somerset at Taunton), twice he took five wickets with consecutive
balls, and any number of times he did the &ldquo;hat-trick,&rdquo; but
he never afterwards achieved so amazing a performance as that of the
celebrated Surrey match.</p>
<p class="par">I am still of opinion that Stott deliberately bowled
carelessly in the second innings of that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>match, but, after
watching him on many fields, and after a careful analysis of his
methods&mdash;and character&mdash;I am quite certain that his
comparative failures in later matches were not due to any purpose on
Stott&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p class="par">Take, for instance, the match which Hampdenshire lost to
Kent in Stott&rsquo;s second season&mdash;their first loss as a
first-class county; their record up to that time was thirteen wins and
six drawn games. It is incredible to me that Stott should have
deliberately allowed Kent to make the necessary one hundred and
eighty-seven runs required in the fourth innings. He took five wickets
for sixty-three; if he could have done better, I am sure he would have
made the effort. He would not have sacrificed his county. I have spoken
of the <i>esprit de corps</i> which held the Hampdenshire Eleven
together, and they were notably proud of their unbeaten record.</p>
<p class="par">No; we must find another reason for Stott&rsquo;s
comparative failures. I believe that I am the only person who knows
that reason, and I say that Stott was the victim of an obsession. His
&ldquo;swerve&rdquo; theory dominated him, he was always experimenting
with it, and when, as in the Kent match I have cited, the game was
played in a flat calm, his failure to influence the trajectory of the
ball in his own peculiar manner, puzzled and upset him. He would strive
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>to make the ball swerve, and in the effort he lost
his length and became playable. Moreover, when Stott was hit he lost
his temper, and then he was useless. Findlater always took him off the
moment he showed signs of temper. The usual sign was a fast full pitch
at the batsman&rsquo;s ribs.</p>
<p class="par">I have one more piece of evidence, the best possible,
which upholds this explanation of mine, but it must follow the account
of Stott&rsquo;s accident.</p>
<p class="par">That accident came during the high flood of Hampdenshire
success. For two years they had held undisputed place as champion
county, a place which could not be upset by the most ingenious methods
of calculating points. They had three times defeated Australia, and
were playing four men in the test matches. As a team they were capable
of beating any Eleven opposed to them. Not even the newspaper critics
denied that.</p>
<p class="par">In this third year of Hampdenshire&rsquo;s triumph,
Australia had sent over the finest eleven that had ever represented the
colony, but they had lost the first two test matches, and they had lost
to Hampdenshire. Nevertheless, they won the rubber, and took back the
&ldquo;ashes.&rdquo; No one has ever denied, I believe, that this was
due to Stott&rsquo;s accident. There is in this case no room for any
one to argue that the argument is based on the fallacy of <i>post</i>
and <i>propter</i>.</p>
<p class="par">The accident appeared insignificant at the time.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>The match was against Notts on the Trent Bridge
ground. I was reporting for three papers; Wallis was not there.</p>
<p class="par">Stott had been taken off. Notts were a poor lot that
year and I think Findlater did not wish to make their defeat appear too
ignominious. Flower was bowling; it was a fast, true wicket, and Stott,
who was a safe field, was at cover.</p>
<p class="par">G. L. Mallinson was batting and making good use of his
opportunity; he was, it will be remembered, a magnificent though
erratic hitter. Flower bowled him a short-pitched, fast ball, rather
wide of the off-stump. Many men might have left it alone, for the ball
was rising, and the slips were crowded, but Mallinson timed the ball
splendidly, and drove it with all his force. He could not keep it on
the ground, however, and Stott had a possible chance. He leaped for it
and just touched the ball with his right hand. The ball jumped the ring
at its first bound, and Mallinson never even attempted to run. There
was a big round of applause from the Trent Bridge crowd.</p>
<p class="par">I noticed that Stott had tied a handkerchief round his
finger, but I forgot the incident until I saw Findlater beckon to his
best bowler, a few overs later. Notts had made enough runs for decency;
it was time to get them out.</p>
<p class="par">I saw Stott walk up to Findlater and shake his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>head, and through my glasses I saw him whip the
handkerchief from his finger and display his hand. Findlater frowned,
said something and looked towards the pavilion, but Stott shook his
head. He evidently disagreed with Findlater&rsquo;s proposal. Then
Mallinson came up, and the great bulk of his back hid the faces of the
other two. The crowd was beginning to grow excited at the interruption.
Every one had guessed that something was wrong. All round the ring men
were standing up, trying to make out what was going on.</p>
<p class="par">I drew my inferences from Mallinson&rsquo;s face, for
when he turned round and strolled back to his wicket, he was wearing a
broad smile. Through my field glasses I could see that he was licking
his lower lip with his tongue. His shoulders were humped and his whole
expression one of barely controlled glee. (I always see that picture
framed in a circle; a bioscopic presentation.) He could hardly refrain
from dancing. Then little Beale, who was Mallinson&rsquo;s partner,
came up and spoke to him, and I saw Mallinson hug himself with delight
as he explained the situation.</p>
<p class="par">When Stott unwillingly came into the pavilion, a low
murmur ran round the ring, like the buzz of a great crowd of disturbed
blue flies. In that murmur I could distinctly trace the signs of mixed
feelings. No doubt the crowd had come there to witness the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>performances of the phenomenon&mdash;the abnormal
of every kind has a wonderful attraction for us&mdash;but, on the other
hand, the majority wanted to see their own county win. Moreover,
Mallinson was giving them a taste of his abnormal powers of hitting,
and the batsman appeals to the spectacular, more than the bowler.</p>
<p class="par">I ran down hurriedly to meet Stott.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Only a split finger, sir,&rdquo; he said
carelessly, in answer to my question; &ldquo;but Mr. Findlater says I
must see to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I examined the finger, and it certainly did not seem to
call for surgical aid. Evidently it had been caught by the seam of the
new ball; there was a fairly clean cut about half an inch long on the
fleshy underside of the second joint of the middle finger.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Better have it seen to,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t afford to lose you, you know, Stott.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Stott gave a laugh that was more nearly a snarl.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad a cut
finger,&rdquo; he said scornfully.</p>
<p class="par">He had the finger bound up when I saw him again, but it
had been done by an amateur. I learnt afterwards that no antiseptic had
been used. That was at lunch time, and Notts had made a hundred and
sixty-eight for one wicket; Mallinson was not out, a hundred and three.
I saw that the Notts Eleven were in magnificent spirits. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But after lunch Stott came out and took the first over.
I don&rsquo;t know what had passed between him and Findlater, but the
captain had evidently been over-persuaded.</p>
<p class="par">We must not blame Findlater. The cut certainly appeared
trifling, it was not bad enough to prevent Stott from bowling, and
Hampdenshire seemed powerless on that wicket without him. It is very
easy to distribute blame after the event, but most people would have
done what Findlater did in those circumstances.</p>
<p class="par">The cut did not appear to inconvenience Stott in the
least degree. He bowled Mallinson with his second ball, and the innings
was finished up in another fifty-seven minutes for the addition of
thirty-eight runs.</p>
<p class="par">Hampdenshire made two hundred and thirty-seven for three
wickets before the drawing of stumps, and that was the end of the
match, for the weather changed during the night and rain prevented any
further play.</p>
<p class="par">I, of course, stayed on in Nottingham to await results.
I saw Stott on the next day, Friday, and asked him about his finger. He
made light of it, but that evening Findlater told me over the
bridge-table that he was not happy about it. He had seen the finger,
and thought it showed a tendency to inflammation. &ldquo;I shall take
him to Gregory in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span>morning if it&rsquo;s not all right,&rdquo;
he said. Gregory was a well-known surgeon in Nottingham.</p>
<p class="par">Again one sees, now, that the visit to Gregory should
not have been postponed, but at the time one does not take
extraordinary precautions in such a case as this. A split finger is
such an everyday thing, and one is guided by the average of experience.
After all, if one were constantly to make preparation for the abnormal,
ordinary life could not go on....</p>
<p class="par">I heard that Gregory pursed his lips over that finger
when he had learned the name of his famous patient. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to be very careful of this, young man,&rdquo; was
Findlater&rsquo;s report of Gregory&rsquo;s advice. It was not
sufficient. I often wonder now whether Gregory might not have saved the
finger. If he had performed some small operation at once, cut away the
poison, it seems to me that the tragedy might have been averted. I am,
I admit, a mere layman in these matters, but it seems to me that
something might have been done.</p>
<p class="par">I left Nottingham on Saturday after lunch&mdash;the
weather was hopeless&mdash;and I did not make use of the information I
had for the purposes of my paper. I was never a good journalist. But I
went down to Ailesworth on Monday morning, and found that Findlater and
Stott had already gone to Harley Street to see Graves, the King&rsquo;s
surgeon.</p>
<p class="par">I followed them, and arrived at Graves&rsquo;s house
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>while Stott was in the consulting-room. I hocussed
the butler and waited with the patients. Among the papers, I came upon
the famous caricature of Stott in the current number of
<i>Punch</i>&mdash;the &ldquo;Stand-and-Deliver&rdquo; caricature, in
which Stott is represented with an arm about ten feet long, and the
batsman is looking wildly over his shoulder to square leg, bewildered,
with no conception from what direction the ball is coming. Underneath
is written &ldquo;Stott&rsquo;s New Theory&mdash;the Ricochet. Real
Ginger.&rdquo; While I was laughing over the cartoon, the butler came
in and nodded to me. I followed him out of the room and met Findlater
and Stott in the hall.</p>
<p class="par">Findlater was in a state of profanity. I could not get a
sensible word out of him. He was in a white heat of pure rage. The
butler, who seemed as anxious as I to learn the verdict, was positively
frightened.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, for God&rsquo;s sake tell me what Graves
said,&rdquo; I protested.</p>
<p class="par">Findlater&rsquo;s answer is unprintable, and told me
nothing.</p>
<p class="par">Stott, however, quite calm and self-possessed,
volunteered the information. &ldquo;Finger&rsquo;s got to come off,
sir,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Doctor says if it ain&rsquo;t off
to-day or to-morrer, he won&rsquo;t answer for my
&rsquo;and.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This was the news I had to give to England. It
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>was a great coup from the journalistic point of
view, but I made up my three columns with a heavy heart, and the
congratulations of my editor only sickened me. I had some luck, but I
should never have become a good journalist.</p>
<p class="par">The operation was performed successfully that evening,
and Stott&rsquo;s career was closed.</p>

<p class="par first">I have already referred to the obsession which
dominated Stott after his accident, and I must now deal with that
overweening anxiety of his to teach his method to another man.</p>
<p class="par">I did not see Stott again till August, and then I had a
long talk with him on the Ailesworth County Ground, as together we
watched the progress of Hampdenshire&rsquo;s defeat by Lancashire.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! I can&rsquo;t learn him
<i>nothing</i>,&rdquo; he broke out, as Flower was hit to the four
corners of the ground, &ldquo;&rsquo;alf vollies and long &rsquo;ops
and then a full pitch&mdash;&rsquo;e&rsquo;s a disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve knocked him off his length,&rdquo;
I protested. &ldquo;On wicket like this....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Stott shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to
learn &rsquo;im,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but he can&rsquo;t never learn.
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s got &rsquo;abits what you can&rsquo;t break &rsquo;im
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I suppose it <i>is</i> difficult,&rdquo; I said
vaguely.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Same with me,&rdquo; went on Stott,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45"
name="pb45">45</a>]</span>trying to learn myself to bowl without my
finger&rdquo;&mdash;he held up his mutilated hand&mdash;&ldquo;or
left-&rsquo;anded; but I can&rsquo;t. If I&rsquo;d started that way....
No! I&rsquo;m always feeling for that finger as is gone. A second-class
bowler I might be in time, not better nor that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early days yet,&rdquo; I ventured,
intending encouragement, but Stott frowned and shook his head.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to kid myself,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I know. But I&rsquo;m going to find a youngster and learn
&rsquo;im. On&rsquo;y he must be young.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No &rsquo;abits, you know,&rdquo; he
explained.</p>
<p class="par">The next time I met Stott was in November. I ran up
against him, literally, one Friday afternoon in Ailesworth.</p>
<p class="par">When he recognised me he asked me if I would care to
walk out to Stoke-Underhill with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve took a cottage
there,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to be married in a
fortnight&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His circumstances certainly warranted such a venture.
The proceeds of matinee and benefit, invested for him by the Committee
of the County Club, produced an income of nearly two pounds a week, and
in addition to this he had his salary as groundsman. I tendered my
congratulations.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! well, as to that, better wait a bit,&rdquo;
said Stott.</p>
<p class="par">He walked with his hands in his pockets and his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>eyes on the ground. He had the air of a man
brooding over some project.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a lottery, of course ...&rdquo; I
began, but he interrupted me.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh that!&rdquo; he said, and kicked a stone into
the ditch; &ldquo;take my chances of that. It&rsquo;s the kid I&rsquo;m
thinking on.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The kid?&rdquo; I repeated, doubtful whether he
spoke of his fianc&eacute;e, or whether his nuptials pointed an act of
reparation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What else &rsquo;ud I tie myself up for?&rdquo;
asked Stott. &ldquo;I must &rsquo;ave a kid of my own and learn
&rsquo;im from his cradle. It&rsquo;s come to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! I understand,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;teach him
to bowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied Stott as an affirmative.
&ldquo;Learn &rsquo;im to bowl from his cradle; before &rsquo;e&rsquo;s
got &rsquo;abits. When I started I&rsquo;d never bowled a ball in my
life, and by good luck I started right. But I can&rsquo;t find another
kid over seven years old in England as ain&rsquo;t never bowled a ball
o&rsquo; some sort and started &rsquo;abits. I&rsquo;ve
tried....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you hope with your own boys...?&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not &rsquo;ope, it&rsquo;s a cert;&rdquo; said
Stott. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see no boy of mine touches a ball afore
he&rsquo;s fourteen, and then &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll learn from me; and
learn right. From the first go off.&rdquo; He was silent for a few
seconds, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>then he broke out in a kind of ecstasy. &ldquo;My
Gawd, &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll be a bowler such as &rsquo;as never been, never
in this world. He&rsquo;ll start where I left orf.
He&rsquo;ll....&rdquo; Words failed him, he fell back on the expletive
he had used, repeating it with an awed fervour. &ldquo;My
Gawd!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I had never seen Stott in this mood before. It was a
revelation to me of the latent potentialities of the man, the
remarkable depth and quality of his ambitions....</p>

<p class="par first">I intended to be present at Stott&rsquo;s wedding,
but I was not in England when it took place; indeed, for the next two
years and a half I was never in England for more than a few days at a
time. I sent him a wedding-present, an inkstand in the guise of a
cricket ball, with a pen-rack that was built of little silver wickets.
They were still advertised that Christmas as &ldquo;Stott
inkstands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Two years and a half of American life broke up many of
my old habits of thought. When I first returned to London I found that
the cricket news no longer held the same interest for me, and this may
account for the fact that I did not trouble for some time to look up my
old friend Stott.</p>
<p class="par">In July, however, affairs took me to Ailesworth, and the
associations of the place naturally led me to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>wonder
how Stott&rsquo;s marriage had turned out, and whether the much-desired
son had been born to him. When my business in Ailesworth was done, I
decided to walk out to Stoke-Underhill.</p>
<p class="par">The road passes the County Ground, and a match was in
progress, but I walked by without stopping. I was wool-gathering. I was
not thinking of the man I was going to see, or I should have turned in
at the County Ground, where he would inevitably have been found.
Instead, I was thinking of the abnormal child I had seen in the train
that day; uselessly speculating and wondering.</p>
<p class="par">When I reached Stoke-Underhill I found the cottage which
Stott had shown me. I had by then so far recovered my wits as to know
that I should not find Stott himself there, but from the look of the
cottage I judged that it was untenanted, so I made inquiries at the
post-office.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No; he don&rsquo;t live here, now, sir,&rdquo;
said the postmistress; &ldquo;he lives at Pym, now, sir, and rides into
Ailesworth on his bike.&rdquo; She was evidently about to furnish me
with other particulars, but I did not care to hear them. I was moody
and distrait. I was wondering why I should bother my head about so
insignificant a person as this Stott.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sure to find Mr. Stott at the
cricket ground,&rdquo; the postmistress called after me.</p>
<p class="par">Another two months of English life induced a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>return to my old habits of thought. I found myself
reverting to old tastes and interests. The reversion was a pleasant
one. In the States I had been forced out of my groove, compelled to
work, to strive, to think desperately if I would maintain any standing
among my contemporaries. But when the perpetual stimulus was removed, I
soon fell back to the less strenuous methods of my own country. I had
time, once more, for the calm reflection that is so unlike the urgent,
forced, inventive thought of the American journalist. I was braced by
that thirty months&rsquo; experience, perhaps hardened a little, but by
September my American life was fading into the background; I had begun
to take an interest in cricket again.</p>
<p class="par">With the revival of my old interests, revived also my
curiosity as to Ginger Stott, and one Sunday in late September I
decided to go down to Pym.</p>
<p class="par">It was a perfect day, and I thoroughly enjoyed my
four-mile walk from Great Hittenden Station.</p>
<p class="par">Pym is a tiny hamlet made up of three farms and a dozen
scattered cottages. Perched on one of the highest summits of the
Hampden Hills and lost in the thick cover of beech woods, without a
post-office or a shop, Pym is the most perfectly isolated village
within a reasonable distance of London. As I sauntered up the mile-long
lane that climbs the steep hill, and is the only connection between Pym
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>and anything approaching a decent road, I thought
that this was the place to which I should like to retire for a year, in
order to write the book I had so often contemplated, and never found
time to begin. This, I reflected, was a place of peace, of freedom from
all distraction, the place for calm, contemplative meditation.</p>
<p class="par">I met no one in the lane, and there was no sign of life
when I reached what I must call the village, though the word conveys a
wrong idea, for there is no street, merely a cottage here and there,
dropped haphazard, and situated without regard to its aspect. These
cottages lie all on one&rsquo;s left hand; to the right a stretch of
grass soon merges into bracken and bush, and then the beech woods
enclose both, and surge down into the valley and rise up again beyond,
a great wave of green; as I saw it then, not yet touched with the first
flame of autumn.</p>
<p class="par">I inquired at the first cottage and received my
direction to Stott&rsquo;s dwelling. It lay up a little lane, the
further of two cottages joined together.</p>
<p class="par">The door stood open, and after a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation and a light knock, I peered in.</p>
<p class="par">Sitting in a rocking-chair was a woman with black,
untidy eyebrows, and on her knee, held with rigid attention, was the
remarkable baby I had seen in the train two months before. As I stood,
doubtful and, I will confess it, intimidated, suddenly cold and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>nervous, the child opened his eyes and honoured me
with a cold stare. Then he nodded, a reflective, recognisable nod.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;E remembers seein&rsquo; you in the train,
sir,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;&rsquo;e never forgets any one. Did
you want to see my &rsquo;usband? &rsquo;E&rsquo;s upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So <i>this</i> was the boy who was designed by Stott to
become the greatest bowler the world had ever seen.... <span class=

<p class="par first">Stott maintained an obstinate silence as we walked
together up to the Common, a stretch of comparatively open ground on
the plateau of the hill. He walked with his hands in his pockets and
his head down, as he had walked out from Ailesworth with me nearly
three years before, but his mood was changed. I was conscious that he
was gloomy, depressed, perhaps a little unstrung. I was burning with
curiosity. Now that I was released from the thrall of the child&rsquo;s
presence, I was eager to hear all there was to tell of its history.</p>
<p class="par">Presently we sat down under an ash-tree, one of three
that guarded a shallow, muddy pond skimmed with weed. Stott accepted my
offer of a cigarette, but seemed disinclined to break the silence.</p>
<p class="par">I found nothing better to say than a repetition of the
old phrase. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very remarkable baby of yours,
Stott,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he replied, his usual substitute for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>&ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and he picked up a piece of
dead wood and threw it into the little pond.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nearly two year.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can he ...&rdquo; I paused; my imagination was
reconstructing the scene of the railway carriage, and I felt a reflex
of the hesitation shown by the rubicund man when he had asked the same
question. &ldquo;Can he ... can he talk?&rdquo; It seemed so absurd a
question to ask, yet it was essentially a natural question in the
circumstances.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He can, but he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This was startling enough, and I pressed my enquiry.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How do you know? Are you sure he can?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Only that aggravating, monosyllabic
assent.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look here, Stott,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want to talk about the child?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He shrugged his shoulders and threw more wood into the
pond with a strained attentiveness as though he were peculiarly anxious
to hit some particular wafer of the vivid, floating weed. For a full
five minutes we maintained silence. I was trying to subdue my
impatience and my temper. I knew Stott well enough to know that if I
displayed signs of either, I should get no information from him. My
self-control was rewarded at last. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"
href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard &rsquo;im speak,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;speak proper, too, not like a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He paused, and I grunted to show that I was listening,
but as he volunteered no further remark, I said: &ldquo;What did you
hear him say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; replied Stott,
&ldquo;somethin&rsquo; about learnin&rsquo; and talkin&rsquo;. I
didn&rsquo;t get the rights of it, but the missus near
fainted&mdash;<i>she</i> thinks &rsquo;e&rsquo;s Gawd A&rsquo;mighty or
suthing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you make him speak?&rdquo; I
asked deliberately.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Make &rsquo;im!&rdquo; said Stott, with a curl of
his lip, &ldquo;<i>make</i> &rsquo;im! You try it on!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I knew I was acting a part, but I wanted to provoke more
information. &ldquo;Well! Why not?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos &rsquo;e&rsquo;d look at
you&mdash;that&rsquo;s why not,&rdquo; replied Stott, &ldquo;and you
can&rsquo;t no more face &rsquo;im than a dog can face a man. I
shan&rsquo;t stand it much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;very
curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s a blarsted freak, that&rsquo;s
what &rsquo;e is,&rdquo; said Stott, getting to his feet and beginning
to pace moodily up and down.</p>
<p class="par">I did not interrupt him. I was thinking of this man who
had drawn huge crowds from every part of England, who had been a
national hero, and who, now, was unable to face his own child.
Presently Stott broke out again. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55"
href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To think of all the trouble I took when &rsquo;e
was comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, stopping in front of me. &ldquo;There
was nothin&rsquo; the missus fancied as I wouldn&rsquo;t get. We was
livin&rsquo; in Stoke then.&rdquo; He made a movement of his head in
the direction of Ailesworth. &ldquo;Not as she was difficult,&rdquo; he
went on thoughtfully. &ldquo;She used to say &lsquo;I mussent get
&rsquo;abits, George,&rsquo; Caught that from me; I was always on about
that&mdash;then. You know, thinkin&rsquo; of learnin&rsquo; &rsquo;im
bowlin&rsquo;. Things was different then; afore <i>&rsquo;e</i>
came.&rdquo; He paused again, evidently thinking of his troubles.</p>
<p class="par">Sympathetically, I was wondering how far the child had
separated husband and wife. There was the making of a tragedy here, I
thought; but when Stott, after another period of pacing up and down,
began to speak again I found that his tragedy was of another kind.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Learn <i>&rsquo;im</i> bowling!&rdquo; he said,
and laughed a mirthless laugh. &ldquo;My Gawd! it &rsquo;ud take
something. No fear; that little game&rsquo;s off. And I could a&rsquo;
done it if he&rsquo;d been a decent or&rsquo;nery child, &rsquo;stead
of a blarsted freak. There won&rsquo;t never be another, neither. This
one pretty near killed the missus. Doctor said it&rsquo;d be &rsquo;er
last.... With an &rsquo;ead like that, whacher expect?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can he walk?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! Gets about easy enough for all &rsquo;is body
and legs is so small. When the missus tries to stop <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>&rsquo;im&mdash;she&rsquo;s afraid
&rsquo;e&rsquo;ll go over&mdash;&rsquo;e just looks at &rsquo;er and
she &rsquo;as to let &rsquo;im &rsquo;ave &rsquo;is own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par first">Later, I reverted to that speech of the
child&rsquo;s, that intelligent, illuminating speech that seemed to
prove that there was indeed a powerful, thoughtful mind behind those
profoundly speculative eyes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That time he spoke, Stott,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;was he alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; assented Stott. &ldquo;In the garden,
practisin&rsquo; walkin&rsquo; all by &rsquo;imself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Was that the only time?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Only time <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> &rsquo;eard
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Was it lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout six weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And he has never made a sound otherwise, cried,

<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;Ardly. &rsquo;E gives a sort o&rsquo;
grunt sometimes, when e&rsquo; wants anything&mdash;and
points.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very intelligent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Worse than that, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s a freak, I tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">With the repetition of this damning description, Stott
fell back into his moody pacing, and this time I failed to rouse him
from his gloom. &ldquo;Oh! forget it,&rdquo; he broke out once, when I
asked him another question, and I saw that he was not likely to give me
any more information that day. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">We walked back together, and I said good-bye to him at
the end of the lane which led up to his cottage.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not comin&rsquo; up?&rdquo; he asked, with a nod
of his head towards his home.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well! I have to catch that train ...&rdquo; I
prevaricated, looking at my watch. I did not wish to see that child
again; my distaste was even stronger than my curiosity.</p>
<p class="par">Stott grinned. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave many
visitors,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll come a bit farther
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He came to the bottom of the hill, and after he left me
he took the road that goes over the hill to Wenderby. It would be about
seven miles back to Pym by that road....</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I spent the next afternoon in the Reading Room of
the British Museum. I was searching for a precedent, and at last I
found one in the story of Christian Heinrich Heinecken,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd22e1261src" href="#xd22e1261" name="xd22e1261src">1</a>
who was born at <span class="corr" id="xd22e1275" title=
"Source: Lubeck">L&uuml;beck</span> on February 6, 1721. There were
marked points of difference between the development of Heinecken and
that of Stott&rsquo;s child. Heinecken was physically feeble; at the
age of three he was still being fed at the breast. The Stott precocity
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>appeared to be physically strong; his body looked
small and undeveloped, it is true, but this was partly an illusion
produced by the abnormal size of the head. Again Heinecken learned to
speak very early; at ten months old he was asking intelligent
questions, at eighteen months he was studying history, geography, Latin
and anatomy; whereas the Stott child had only once been heard to speak
at the age of two years, and had not, apparently, begun any study at
all.</p>
<p class="par">From this comparison it might seem at first that the
balance of precocity lay in the Heinecken scale. I drew another
inference. I argued that the genius of the Stott child far outweighed
the genius of Christian Heinecken.</p>
<p class="par">Little Heinecken in his four years of life suffered the
mental experience&mdash;with certain necessary limitations&mdash;of a
developed brain. He gathered knowledge as an ordinary child gathers
knowledge, the only difference being that his rate of assimilation was
as ten to one.</p>
<p class="par">But little Stott had gathered no knowledge from books.
He had been born of ignorant parents, he was being brought up among
uneducated people. Yet he had wonderful intellectual gifts: surely he
must have one above all others&mdash;the gift of reason. His brain must
be constructive, logical; he must have the power of deduction. He must
even at an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>extraordinarily early age, say six months, have
developed some theory of life. He must be withholding his energy,
deliberately; declining to exhibit his powers, holding his marvellous
faculties in reserve. Here was surely a case of genius which,
comparable in some respects to the genius of Heinecken, yet far
exceeded it.</p>
<p class="par">As I developed my theory, my eagerness grew. And then
suddenly an inspiration came to me. In my excitement I spoke aloud and
smacked the desk in front of me with my open hand. &ldquo;Why, of
course!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That is the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">An old man in the next seat scowled fiercely. The
attendants in the central circular desk all looked up. Other readers
turned round and stared at me. I had violated the sacred laws of the
Reading Room. I saw one of the librarians make a sign to an attendant
and point to me.</p>
<p class="par">I gathered up my books quickly and returned them at the
central desk. My self-consciousness had returned, and I was anxious to
be away from the observation of the many dilettante readers who found
my appearance more engrossing than the books with which they were
dallying on some pretext or another.</p>
<p class="par">Yet, curiously, when I reached the street, the theory
which had come to me in the Museum with the force and vividness of an
illuminating dream <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60"
name="pb60">60</a>]</span>had lost some of its glamour. Nevertheless, I
set it out as it then shaped itself in my mind.</p>
<p class="par">The great restraining force in the evolution of man, so
I thought, has been the restriction imposed by habit. What we call
instinct is a hereditary habit. This is the first guiding principle in
the life of the human infant. Upon this instinct we immediately
superimpose the habits of reason, all the bodily and intellectual
conventions that have been handed down from generation to generation.
We learn everything we know as children by the hereditary, simian habit
of imitation. The child of intellectual, cultured parents, born into
savage surroundings, becomes the slave of this inherited
habit&mdash;call it tendency, if you will, the intention is the same. I
elaborated the theory by instance and introspection, and found no flaw
in it....</p>
<p class="par">And here, by some freak of nature, was a child born
without these habits. During the period of gestation, one thought had
dominated the minds of both parents&mdash;the desire to have a son born
without habits. It does not seriously affect the theory that the desire
had a peculiar end in view; the wish, the urgent, controlling,
omnipotent will had been there, and the result included far more than
the specific intention.</p>
<p class="par">Already some of my distaste for the Stott child had
vanished. It was accountable, and therefore <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>no
longer fearful. The child was supernormal, a cause of fear to the
normal man, as all truly supernormal things are to our primitive,
animal instincts. This is the fear of the wild thing; when we can
explain and give reasons, the horror vanishes. We are men again.</p>
<p class="par">I did not quite recover the glow of my first
inspiration, but the theory remained with me; I decided to make a study
of the child, to submit knowledge to his reason. I would stand between
him and the delimiting training of the pedagogue, I thought.</p>
<p class="par">Then I reached home, and my life was changed.</p>
<p class="par">This story is not of my own life, and I have no wish to
enter into the curious and saddening experiences which stood between me
and the child of Ginger Stott for nearly six years. In that time my
thoughts strayed now and again to that cottage in the little hamlet on
those wooded hills. Often I thought &ldquo;When I have time I will go
and see that child again if he is alive.&rdquo; But as the years
passed, the memory of him grew dim, even the memory of his father was
blurred over by a thousand new impressions. So it chanced that for
nearly six years I heard no word of Stott and his supernormal infant,
and then chance again intervened. My long period of sorrow came to an
end almost as suddenly as it had begun, and by a coincidence I was once
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>more entangled in the strange web of the
phenomenal.</p>
<p class="par">In this story of Victor Stott I have bridged these six
years in the pages that follow. In doing this I have been compelled to
draw to a certain extent on my imagination, but the main facts are
true. They have been gathered from first-hand authority only, from
Henty Challis, from Mrs. Stott, and from her husband; though none, I
must confess, has been checked by that soundest of all authorities,
Victor Stott himself, who might have given me every particular in
accurate detail, had it not been for those peculiarities of his which
will be explained fully in the proper place. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Stoke-Underhill lies in the flat of the valley
that separates the Hampden from the Quainton Hills. The main road from
London to Ailesworth does not pass through Stoke, but from the highway
you can see the ascent of the bridge over the railway, down the vista
of the straight mile of side road; and, beyond, a glimpse of scattered
cottages. That is all, and as a matter of fact, no one who is not
keeping a sharp look-out would ever notice the village, for the eye is
drawn to admire the bluff of Deane Hill, the highest point of the
Hampdens, which lowers over the little hamlet of Stoke and gives it a
second name; and to the church tower of Chilborough Beacon, away to the
right, another landmark.</p>
<p class="par">The attraction which Stoke-Underhill held for Stott, lay
not in its seclusion or its picturesqueness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>but in
its nearness to the County Ground. Stott could ride the two flat miles
which separated him from the scene of his work in ten minutes, and
Ailesworth station is only a mile beyond. So when he found that there
was a suitable cottage to let in Stoke, he looked no farther for a
home; he was completely satisfied.</p>
<p class="par">Stott&rsquo;s absorption in any matter that was
occupying his mind, made him exceedingly careless about the detail of
his affairs. He took the first cottage that offered when he looked for
a home, he took the first woman who offered when he looked for a
wife.</p>
<p class="par">Stott was not an attractive man to women. He was short
and plain, and he had an appearance of being slightly deformed, a
&ldquo;monkeyish&rdquo; look, due to his build and his long arms.
Still, he was famous, and might, doubtless, have been accepted by a
dozen comely young women for that reason, even after his accident. But
if Stott was unattractive to women, women were even more unattractive
to Stott. &ldquo;No opinion of women?&rdquo; he used to say.
&ldquo;Ever seen a gel try to throw a cricket ball? You &rsquo;ave?
Well, ain&rsquo;t that enough to put you off women?&rdquo; That was
Stott&rsquo;s intellectual standard; physically, he had never felt
drawn to women.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary Jakes exhibited no superiority over her
sisters in the matter of throwing a cricket ball. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>She was
a friend of Ginger&rsquo;s mother, and she was a woman of forty-two,
who had long since been relegated to some remote shelf of the
matrimonial exchange. But her physical disadvantages were outbalanced
by her mental qualities. Ellen Mary was not a book-worm, she read
nothing but the evening and Sunday papers, but she had a reasoning and
intelligent mind.</p>
<p class="par">She had often contemplated the state of matrimony, and
had made more than one tentative essay in that direction. She had
walked out with three or four sprigs of the Ailesworth bourgeoisie in
her time, and the shadow of middle-age had crept upon her before she
realised that however pliant her disposition, her lack of physical
charm put her at the mercy of the first bright-eyed rival. At
thirty-five Ellen had decided, with admirable philosophy, that marriage
was not for her, and had assumed, with apparent complacency, the
outward evidences of a dignified spinsterhood. She had discarded gay
hats and ribbons, imitation jewellery, unreliable cheap shoes, and
chill diaphanous stockings, and had found some solace for her
singleness in more comfortable and suitable apparel.</p>
<p class="par">When Ellen, a declared spinster of seven years&rsquo;
standing, was first taken into the confidence of Ginger Stott&rsquo;s
mother, the scheme which she afterwards elaborated immediately
presented itself to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68"
name="pb68">68</a>]</span>her mind. This fact is a curious instance of
Ellen Mary&rsquo;s mobility of intellect, and the student of heredity
may here find matter for careful thought.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd22e1353src" href="#xd22e1353" name="xd22e1353src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">The confidence in question was Ginger&rsquo;s declared
intention of becoming the father of the world&rsquo;s greatest bowler.
Mrs. Stott was a dark, garrulous, rather deaf little woman, with a keen
eye for the main chance; she might have become a successful woman of
business if she had not been by nature both stingy and a cheat. When
her son presented his determination, her first thought was to find some
woman who would not dissipate her son&rsquo;s substance, and in her
opinion&mdash;not expressed to Ginger&mdash;the advertised purpose of
the contemplated marriage evidenced a wasteful disposition.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Stott did not think of Ellen Mary as a possible
daughter-in-law, but she did hold forth for an hour and three-quarters
on the contemptible qualities of the young maidens, first of
Ailesworth, and then with a wider swoop that was not justified by her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>limited experience, of the girls of England,
Scotland, and Ireland at large.</p>
<p class="par">It required the flexible reasoning powers of Ellen Mary
to find a solution of the problem. Any ordinary, average woman of
forty-two, a declared spinster of seven years&rsquo; standing, who had
lived all her life in a provincial town, would have been mentally
unable to realise the possibilities of the situation. Such a
representative of the decaying sexual instinct would have needed the
stimulus of courtship, at the least of some hint of preference
displayed by the suitor. Ruled by the conventions which hold her sex in
bondage, she would have deemed it unwomanly to make advances by any
means other than innuendo, the subtle suggestions which are the
instruments of her sex, but which are often too delicate to pierce the
understanding of the obtuse and slow-witted male.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary stood outside the ruck that determines the
destinies of all such typical representatives. She considered the idea
presented to her by Mrs. Stott with an open and mobile intelligence.
She weighed the character of Ginger, the possibilities of rejection,
and the influence of Mrs. Stott; and she gave no thought to the
conventions, nor to the criticisms of Ailesworth society. When she had
decided that such chances as she could calculate were in her favour,
Ellen made up her mind, walked out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70"
href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>to the County Ground one windy
October forenoon, and discovered Ginger experimenting with grass seed
in a shed off the pavilion.</p>
<p class="par">In this shed she offered herself, while Ginger worked
on, attentive but unresponsive. Perhaps she did not make an offer so
much as state a case. A masterly case, without question; for who can
doubt that Stott, however procrastinating and unwilling to make a
definite overture, must already have had some type of womanhood in his
mind; some conception, the seed of an ideal.</p>
<p class="par">I find a quality of romance in this courageous and
unusual wooing of Ellen Mary&rsquo;s; but more, I find evidences of the
remarkable quality of her intelligence. In other circumstances the name
of Ellen Mary Jakes might have stood for individual achievement,
instead, she is remembered as a common woman who <i>happened</i> to be
the mother of Victor Stott. But when the facts are examined, can we say
that chance entered? If ever the birth of a child was deliberately
designed by both parents, it was in the case under consideration. And
what a strange setting to the inception.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary, a gaunt, tall, somewhat untidy woman, stood
at the narrow door of the little shed off the Ailesworth pavilion; with
one hand, shoulder-high, she steadied herself against the door frame,
with the other she continually pushed forward <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>the
rusty bonnet which had been loosened during her walk by the equinoctial
gale that now tore at the door of the shed, and necessitated the
employment of a wary foot to keep the door from slamming. With all
these distractions she still made good her case, though she had to
raise her voice above the multitudinous sounds of the wind, and though
she had to address the unresponsive shoulders of a man who bent over
shallow trays of earth set on a trestle table under the small and dirty
window. It is heroic, but she had her reward in full measure. Presently
her voice ceased, and she waited in silence for the answer that should
decide her destiny. There was an interval broken only by the tireless
passion of the wind, and then Ginger Stott, the best-known man in
England, looked up and stared through the incrusted pane of glass
before him at the dim vision of grass and swaying hedge. Unconsciously
his hands strayed to his pockets, and then he said in a low, thoughtful
voice: &ldquo;Well! I dunno why not.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Dr. O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s face was white and
drawn, and the redness of his eyelids more pronounced than ever as he
faced Stott in the pale October dawn. He clutched at his beard with a
nervous, combing movement, as he shook his head decidedly in answer to
the question put to him<span class="corr" id="xd22e1385" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72"
name="pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not dead, now, &rsquo;twill be in
very few hours,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">Stott was shaken by the feeble passion of a man who has
spent many weary hours of suspense. His anger thrilled out in a feeble
stream of hackneyed profanities.</p>
<p class="par">O&rsquo;Connell looked down on him with contempt. At
sunrise, after a sleepless night, a man is a creature of unrealised
emotions.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Damn it, control yourself, man!&rdquo; growled
O&rsquo;Connell, himself uncontrolled, &ldquo;your wife&rsquo;ll pull
through with care, though she&rsquo;ll never have another child.&rdquo;
O&rsquo;Connell did not understand; he was an Irishman, and no
cricketer; he had been called in because he had a reputation for his
skill in obstetrics.</p>
<p class="par">Stott stared at him fiercely. The two men seemed as if
about to grapple desperately for life in the windy, grey twilight.</p>
<p class="par">O&rsquo;Connell recovered his self-control first, and
began again to claw nervously at his beard. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a
fool,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only what you could expect. Her
first child, and her a woman of near fifty.&rdquo; He returned to the
upstairs room; Stott seized his cap and went out into the chill world
of sunrise.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do, if there are no
complications,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Connell to the nurse, as he bent
over the still, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>exhausted figure of Mrs. Stott. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
a wonderful woman to have delivered such a child alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The nurse shivered, and avoiding any glance at the
huddle that lay on an improvised sofa-bed, she said: &ldquo;It
can&rsquo;t live, can it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">O&rsquo;Connell, still intent on his first patient,
shook his head. &ldquo;Never cried after delivery,&rdquo; he muttered
&ldquo;&mdash;the worst sign.&rdquo; He was silent for a moment and
then he added: &ldquo;But, to be sure, it&rsquo;s a freak of some
kind.&rdquo; His scientific curiosity led him to make a further
investigation. He left the bed and began to examine the huddle on the
sofa-couch. Victor Stott owed his life, in the first instance, to this
scientific curiosity of O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="par">The nurse, a capable, but sentimental woman, turned to
the window and looked out at the watery trickle of feeble sunlight that
now illumined the wilderness of Stott&rsquo;s garden.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nurse!&rdquo; The imperative call startled her;
she turned nervously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, doctor?&rdquo; she said, making no movement
towards him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connell was kneeling by
the sofa. &ldquo;There seems to be complete paralysis of all the motor
centres,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;but the child&rsquo;s not dead.
We&rsquo;ll try artificial respiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The nurse overcame her repugnance by a visible effort.
&ldquo;Is it ... is it worth while?&rdquo; she asked, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>regarding the flaccid, tumbled, wax-like thing,
with its bloated, white globe of a skull. Every muscle of it was
relaxed and limp, its eyes shut, its tiny jaw hanging.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to let it die...?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">O&rsquo;Connell did not seem to hear her. He waved an
impatient hand for her assistance. &ldquo;Outside my experience,&rdquo;
he muttered, &ldquo;no heart-beat discernible, no breath ... yet it is
indubitably alive.&rdquo; He depressed the soft, plastic ribs and gave
the feeble heart a gentle squeeze.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beating,&rdquo; he ejaculated, after a
pause, with an ear close to the little chest, &ldquo;but still no
breath! Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The diminutive lungs were as readily open to suggestion
as the wee heart: a few movements of the twigs they called arms, and
the breath came. O&rsquo;Connell closed the mouth and it remained
closed, adjusted the limbs, and they stayed in the positions in which
they were placed. At last he gently lifted the lids of the eyes.</p>
<p class="par">The nurse shivered and drew back. Even O&rsquo;Connell
was startled, for the eyes that stared into his own seemed to be heavy
with a brooding intelligence....</p>
<p class="par">Stott came back at ten o&rsquo;clock, after a morose
trudge through the misty rain. He found the nurse in the sitting-room.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Doctor gone?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">The nurse nodded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dead, I suppose?&rdquo; Stott gave an upward
twist of his head towards the room above.</p>
<p class="par">The nurse shook her head.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t live though?&rdquo; There was a note
of faint hope in his voice.</p>
<p class="par">The nurse drew herself together and sighed deeply.
&ldquo;Yes! we believe it&rsquo;ll live, Mr. Stott,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But ... it&rsquo;s a very remarkable baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">How that phrase always recurred!</p>

<p class="par first">There were no complications, but Mrs.
Stott&rsquo;s recovery was not a rapid one. It was considered advisable
that she should not see the child. She thought that they were lying to
her, that the child was dead and, so, resigned herself. But her husband
saw it.</p>
<p class="par">He had never seen so young an infant before, and, just
for one moment, he believed that it was a normal child.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What an &rsquo;ead!&rdquo; was his first
ejaculation, and then he realised the significance of that sign. Fear
came into his eyes, and his mouth fell open. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, I say,
nurse, it&rsquo;s ... it&rsquo;s a wrong &rsquo;un, ain&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; he gasped. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> I can&rsquo;t tell you, Mr.
Stott,&rdquo; broke out the nurse hysterically. She had been feeding
and tending that curious baby for three hours, and she was on the verge
of a break-down. There was no wet-nurse to be had, but a woman from the
village had been sent for. She was expected every moment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;More like a tadpole than anything,&rdquo; mused
the unhappy father.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! Mr. Stott, for goodness&rsquo; sake,
<i>don&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; cried the nurse. &ldquo;If you only
knew....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo; questioned Stott, still staring
at the motionless figure of his son, who lay with closed eyes,
apparently unconscious.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know,&rdquo; began the nurse, and then after a pause, during which she
seemed to struggle for some means of expression, she continued with a
sigh of utter weariness, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know when it opens its
eyes. Oh! Why doesn&rsquo;t that woman come, the woman you sent
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;ere directly,&rdquo;
replied Stott. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean about there bein&rsquo;
something ... something what?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Uncanny,&rdquo; said the nurse without
conviction. &ldquo;I do wish that woman would come. I&rsquo;ve been up
the best part of the night, and now....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Uncanny? As how?&rdquo; persisted Stott.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not normal,&rdquo; explained the nurse. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t tell you more than that.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But &rsquo;ow? What way?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He did not receive an answer then; for the long expected
relief came at last, a great hulk of a woman, who became voluble when
she saw the child she had come to nurse.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! dear, oh! dear,&rdquo; the stream began.
&ldquo;How unforchnit, and &rsquo;er first, too. It&rsquo;ll be a
idjit, I&rsquo;m afraid. Mrs. &rsquo;Arrison&rsquo;s third was the very
spit of it....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The stream ran on, but Stott heard no more. An idiot! He
had fathered an idiot! That was the end of his dreams and ambitions! He
had had an hour&rsquo;s sleep on the sitting-room sofa. He went out to
his work at the County Ground with a heart full of blasphemy.</p>
<p class="par">When he returned at four o&rsquo;clock he met the stout
woman on the doorstep. She put up a hand to her rolling breast, closed
her eyes tightly, and gasped as though completely overcome by this
trifling rencounter.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow is it?&rdquo; questioned the obsessed
Stott.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh dear! Oh dear!&rdquo; panted the stout woman,
&ldquo;the leas&rsquo; thing upsets me this afternoon....&rdquo; She
wandered away into irrelevant fluency, but Stott was autocratic; his
insistent questions overcame the inertia of even Mrs. Reade at last.
The substance of her information, freed from extraneous matter, was as
follows: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! &rsquo;ealthy? It&rsquo;ll live, I&rsquo;ve
no doubt, if that&rsquo;s what you mean; but &rsquo;elpless...! There,
&rsquo;elpless is no word.... Learn &rsquo;im to take the bottle, learn
&rsquo;im to close &rsquo;is &rsquo;ands, learn &rsquo;im to go to
sleep, learn &rsquo;im everythink. I&rsquo;ve never seen nothink like
it, never in all my days, and I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;elped to bring a few
into the world.... I can&rsquo;t begin to tell you about it, Mr. Stott,
and that&rsquo;s the solemn truth. When &rsquo;e first looked at me, I
near &rsquo;ad a faint. A old-fashioned, wise sort of look as &rsquo;e
might &rsquo;a been a &rsquo;undred. &lsquo;Lord &rsquo;elp us,
nurse,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;Lord help us.&rsquo; I was that opset, I
didn&rsquo;t rightly know what I was a-saying....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Stott pushed past the agitated Mrs. Reade, and went into
the sitting-room. He had had neither breakfast nor lunch; there was no
sign of any preparation for his tea, and the fireplace was grey with
the cinders of last night&rsquo;s fire. For some minutes he sat in deep
despondency, a hero faced with the uncompromising detail of domestic
neglect. Then he rose and called to the nurse.</p>
<p class="par">She appeared at the head of the steep, narrow staircase.
&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; she warned, with a finger to her lips.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; out again,&rdquo; said
Stott in a slightly modulated voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mrs. Reade&rsquo;s coming back presently,&rdquo;
replied the nurse, and looked over her shoulder. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Want me to wait?&rdquo; asked Stott.</p>
<p class="par">The nurse came down a few steps. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
in case any one was wanted,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got two
of &rsquo;em on my hands, you see. They&rsquo;re both doing well as far
as that goes. Only....&rdquo; She broke off and drifted into small
talk. Ever and again she stopped and listened intently, and looked back
towards the half-open door of the upstairs room.</p>
<p class="par">Stott fidgeted, and then, as the flow of conversation
gave no sign of running dry, he damned it abruptly. &ldquo;Look
&rsquo;ere, miss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad nothing
to eat since last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! dear!&rdquo; ejaculated the nurse.
&ldquo;If&mdash;perhaps, if you&rsquo;d just stay here and listen, I
could get you something.&rdquo; She seemed relieved to have some excuse
for coming down.</p>
<p class="par">While she bustled about the kitchen, Stott, half-way
upstairs, stayed and listened. The house was very silent, the only
sound was the hushed clatter made by the nurse in the kitchen. There
was an atmosphere of wariness about the place that affected even so
callous a person as Stott. He listened with strained attention, his
eyes fixed on the half-open door. He was not an imaginative man, but he
was beset with apprehension as to what lay behind that door. He looked
for something inhuman that might come crawling through the aperture,
something <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>grotesque, preternaturally wise and
threatening&mdash;something horribly unnatural.</p>
<p class="par">The window of the upstairs room was evidently open, and
now and again the door creaked faintly. When that happened Stott
gripped the handrail, and grew damp and hot. He looked always at the
shadows under the door&mdash;if it crawled....</p>
<p class="par">The nurse stood at the door of the sitting-room while
Stott ate, and presently Mrs. Reade came grunting and panting up the
brick path.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out, now,&rdquo; said Stott
resolutely, and he rose to his feet, though his meal was barely
finished.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be back before Mrs. Reade
goes?&rdquo; asked the nurse, and passed a hand over her tired eyes.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here till ten o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;m going to
lie down.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back by ten,&rdquo; Stott assured
her as he went out.</p>
<p class="par">He did come back at ten o&rsquo;clock, but he was
stupidly drunk.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Stotts&rsquo; cottage was no place to live in
during the next few days, but the nurse made one stipulation; Mr. Stott
must come home to sleep. He slept on an improvised bed in the
sitting-room, and during the night the nurse came down many times and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>listened to the sound of his snores. She would put
her ear against the door, and rest her nerves with the thought of human
companionship. Sometimes she opened the door quietly and watched him as
he slept. Except at night, when he was rarely quite sober, Stott only
visited his cottage once a day, at lunch time; from seven in the
morning till ten at night he remained in Ailesworth save for this one
call of inquiry.</p>
<p class="par">It was such a still house. Ellen Mary only spoke when
speech was absolutely required, and then her words were the fewest
possible, and were spoken in a whisper. The child made no sound of any
kind. Even Mrs. Reade tried to subdue her stertorous breathing, to move
with less ponderous quakings. The neighbours told her she looked
thinner.</p>
<p class="par">Little wonder that during the long night vigil the
nurse, moving silently between the two upstairs rooms, should pause on
the landing and lean over the handrail; little wonder that she should
give a long sigh of relief when she heard the music of Stott&rsquo;s
snore ascend from the sitting-room.</p>
<p class="par">O&rsquo;Connell called twice every day during the first
week, not because it was necessary for him to visit his two patients,
but because the infant fascinated him. He would wait for it to open its
eyes, and then would get up and leave the room hurriedly. Always he
intended to return the infant&rsquo;s stare, but when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>the
opportunity was given to him, he always rose and left the room&mdash;no
matter how long and deliberately he had braced himself to another
course of action.</p>
<p class="par">It was on a Thursday that the baby was born, and it was
on the following Thursday that the circumstance of the household was
reshaped.</p>
<p class="par">O&rsquo;Connell came in the morning, full of resolution.
After he had pronounced Mrs. Stott well on the way to recovery, he paid
the usual visit to his younger patient. The child lay, relaxed, at full
length, in the little cot which had been provided for him. His eyes
were, as usual, closed, and he had all the appearance of the ordinary
hydrocephalic idiot.</p>
<p class="par">O&rsquo;Connell sat down by the cot, listened to the
child&rsquo;s breathing and heart-beat, lifted and let fall again the
lax wrist, turned back the eyelid, revealing only the white of the
upturned eyeball, and then composed himself to await the natural waking
of the child, if it were asleep&mdash;always a matter of
uncertainty.</p>
<p class="par">The nurse stood near him, silent, but she looked away
from the cot.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hydrocephalus!&rdquo; murmured O&rsquo;Connell,
staring at his tiny patient, &ldquo;hydrocephalus, without a doubt. Eh?
nurse!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, perhaps! I don&rsquo;t know,
doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, not a doubt of it, not a doubt,&rdquo;
repeated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>O&rsquo;Connell, and then came a flicker of the
child&rsquo;s eyelids and a weak crumpling of the tiny hand.</p>
<p class="par">O&rsquo;Connell caught his breath and clawed at his
beard; &ldquo;Hydrocephalus,&rdquo; he muttered with set jaw and drawn
eyebrows.</p>
<p class="par">The tiny hand straightened with a movement that
suggested the recovery of crushed grass, the mouth opened with a
microscopic yawn, and then the eyelids were slowly raised and a steady
unwavering stare of profoundest intelligence met
O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s gaze.</p>
<p class="par">He clenched his hands, shifted in his chair, and then
rose abruptly and turned to the window.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&mdash;it won&rsquo;t be necessary for me to
come again, nurse,&rdquo; he said curtly; &ldquo;they are both doing
perfectly well.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not come again?&rdquo; There was dismay in the
nurse&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No! No! It&rsquo;s unnecessary....&rdquo; He
broke off, and made for the door without another glance in the
direction of the cot.</p>
<p class="par">Nurse followed him downstairs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m wanted&mdash;you can easily send for
me,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Connell, as he went out. As he moved away he
dragged at his beard and murmured &ldquo;Hydrocephalus, not a doubt of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Following his departure, Mrs. Reade heard curious and
most unwonted laughter, and cautiously blundered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>downstairs to investigate. She found the nurse in
an advanced condition of hysteria, laughing, gurgling, weeping, and
intermittently crying in a shrill voice: &ldquo;Oh! Lord have mercy;
Lord ha&rsquo; mercy!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now, see you &rsquo;ere, my dear,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Reade, when nurse had been recovered to a red-eyed sanity,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s time she was told. I&rsquo;ve never &rsquo;eld with
keepin&rsquo; it from &rsquo;er, myself, and I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad more
experience than many....&rdquo; Mrs. Reade argued with abundant
recourse to parenthesis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is she strog edough?&rdquo; asked the nurse,
still with tears in her voice; &ldquo;cad she bear the sight of
hib?&rdquo; She blew her nose vigorously, and then continued with
greater clearness: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it may turn her
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Out of her deep store of wisdom, Mrs. Reade produced a
fact which she elaborated and confirmed by apt illustration, adducing
more particularly the instance of Mrs. Harrison&rsquo;s third.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s &rsquo;is mother,&rdquo; was the essence of her
argument, a fact of deep and strange significance.</p>
<p class="par">The nurse yielded, and so the circumstance of
Stott&rsquo;s household was changed, and Stott himself was once more
able to come home to meals.</p>
<p class="par">The nurse, wisely, left all diplomacy to the capable
Mrs. Reade, a woman specially fitted by nature for the breaking of
news. She delivered a long, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href=
"#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>record-breaking circumlocution, and
it seemed that Ellen Mary, who lay with closed eyes, gathered no hint
of its import. But when the impressive harangue was slowly rustling to
collapse like an exhausted balloon, she opened her eyes and said quite
clearly,</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with &rsquo;im,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The question had the effect of reinflation, but at last
the child itself was brought, and it was open-eyed.</p>
<p class="par">The supreme ambition of all great women&mdash;and have
not all women the potentialities of greatness?&mdash;is to give birth
to a god. That ambition it is which is marred by the disappointing
birth of a female child&mdash;when the man-child is born, there is
always hope, and slow is the realisation of failure. That realisation
never came to Ellen Mary. She accepted her child with the fear that is
adoration. When she dropped her eyes before her god&rsquo;s searching
glance, she did it in reverence. She hid her faith from the world, but
in her heart she believed that she was blessed above all women. In
secret, she worshipped the inscrutable wonder that had used her as the
instrument of his incarnation. Perhaps she was right.... <span class=

not make a great point of this curious observation, but the tendency of
more recent analyses is all in the direction of confirming the

<p class="par first">The village of Stoke was no whit intimidated by
the news that Mrs. Reade sowed abroad. The women exclaimed and
chattered, the men gaped and shook their heads, the children hung about
the ruinous gate that shut them out from the twenty-yard strip of
garden which led up to Stott&rsquo;s cottage. Curiosity was the
dominant emotion. Any excuse was good enough to make friendly
overtures, but the babe remained invisible to all save Mrs. Reade; and
the village community kept open ears while the lust of its eyes
remained, perforce, unsatisfied. If Stott&rsquo;s gate slammed in the
wind, every door that commanded a view of that gate was opened, and
heads appeared, and bare arms&mdash;the indications of women who nodded
to each other, shook their heads, pursed their lips and withdrew for
the time to attend the pressure of household duty. Later, even that
gate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>slamming would reinvigorate the gossip of
backyards and front doorways.</p>
<p class="par">The first stranger to force an entry was the rector. He
was an Oxford man who, in his youth, had been an ardent disciple of the
school that attempts the reconciliation of Religion and Science. He had
been ambitious, but nature had predetermined his career by giving him a
head of the wrong shape. At Oxford his limitations had not been clearly
defined, and on the strength of a certain speech at the Union, he crept
into a London west-end curacy. There he attempted to demonstrate the
principle of reconciliation from the pulpit, but his vicar and his
bishop soon recognised that excellent as were his intentions, he was
doing better service to agnosticism than to his own religion. In
consequence he was vilely marooned on the savage island of
Stoke-Underhill, where he might preach as much science as he would to
the natives, for there was no fear of their comprehending him. Fifteen
years of Stoke had brought about a reaction. Nature had made him a
feeble fanatic, and he was now as ardent an opponent of science as he
had once been a defender. In his little mind he believed that his early
reading had enabled him to understand all the weaknesses of the
scientific position. His name was Percy Crashaw.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Stott could not deny her rector the right of entry,
and he insisted on seeing the infant, who was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>not yet
baptised&mdash;a shameful neglect, according to Crashaw, for the child
was nearly six weeks old. Nor had Mrs. Stott been
&ldquo;churched.&rdquo; Crashaw had good excuse for pressing his
call.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Stott refused to face the village. She knew that
the place was all agape, eager to stare at what they considered some
&ldquo;new kind of idiot.&rdquo; Let them wait, was Ellen Mary&rsquo;s
attitude. Her pride was a later development. In those early weeks she
feared criticism.</p>
<p class="par">But she granted Crashaw&rsquo;s request to see the
child, and after the interview (the term is precise) the rector gave
way on the question of a private ceremony, though he had indignantly
opposed the scheme when it was first mooted. It may be that he
conceived an image of himself with that child in his arms, the cynosure
of a packed congregation....</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw was one of the influences that hastened the
Stotts&rsquo; departure from Stoke. He was so indiscreet. After the
christening he would talk. His attitude is quite comprehensible. He,
the lawgiver of Stoke, had been thwarted. He had to find apology for
the private baptism he had denied to many a sickly infant. Moreover,
the Stotts had broken another of his ordinances, for father and mother
had stood as god-parents to their own child, and Crashaw himself had
been the second godfather ordained as necessary by the rubric. He had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>given way on these important points so weakly; he
had to find excuse, and he talked himself into a false belief with
regard to the child he had baptised.</p>
<p class="par">He began with his wife. &ldquo;I would allow more
latitude to medical men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In such a case as this
child of the Stotts, for instance; it becomes a burden on the
community, I might say a danger, yes, a positive danger. I am not sure
whether I was right in administering the holy sacrament of
baptism....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! Percy! Surely ...&rdquo; began Mrs.
Crashaw.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One moment, my dear,&rdquo; protested the rector,
&ldquo;I have not fully explained the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;
And as he warmed to his theme the image of Victor Stott grew to a
fearful grotesqueness. It loomed as a threat over the community and the
church. Crashaw quoted, inaccurately, statistics of the growth of
lunacy, and then went off at a tangent into the theory of possession by
evil spirits. Since his rejection of science, he had lapsed into
certain forms of medi&aelig;valism, and he now began to dally with a
theory of a malign incarnation which he elaborated until it became an
article of his faith.</p>
<p class="par">To his poorer parishioners he spoke in vague terms, but
he changed their attitude; he filled them with overawed terror. They
were intensely curious still, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href=
"#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>but, now, when the gate was slammed,
one saw a face pressed to the window, the door remained fast; and the
children no longer clustered round that gate, but dared each other to
run past it; which they did, the girls with a scream, the boys with a
jeering &ldquo;Yah&mdash;ah!&rdquo; a boast of intrepidity.</p>
<p class="par">This change of temper was soon understood by the persons
most concerned. Stott grumbled and grew more morose. He had never been
intimate with the villagers, and now he avoided any intercourse with
them. His wife kept herself aloof, and her child sheltered from profane
observation. Naturally, this attitude of the Stotts fostered suspicion.
Even the hardiest sceptic in the taproom of the Challis Arms began to
shake his head, to concede that there &ldquo;moight be soomething in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Yet the departure from Stoke might have been postponed
indefinitely, if it had not been for another intrusion. Both Stott and
his wife were ready to take up a new idea, but they were slow to
conceive it.</p>

"pb91">91</a>]</span>scholarship, whose ambition had been smothered by
the heaviness of his possessions. He had a remarkably fine library at
Challis Court, but he made little use of it, for he spent the greater
part of his time in travel. In appearance he was rather an ungainly
man; his great head and the bulk of his big shoulders were something
too heavy for his legs.</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw regarded his patron with mixed feelings. For
Challis, the man of property, the man of high connections, of intimate
associations with the world of science and letters, Crashaw had a
feeling of awed respect; but in private he inveighed against the
wickedness of Challis, the agnostic, the decadent.</p>
<p class="par">When Victor Stott was nearly three months old, the
rector met his patron one day on the road between Chilborough and
Stoke. It was three years since their last meeting, and Crashaw noticed
that in the interval Challis&rsquo;s pointed beard had become streaked
with grey.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hallo! How d&rsquo;ye do, Crashaw?&rdquo; was the
squire&rsquo;s casual greeting. &ldquo;How is the Stoke
microcosm?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw smiled subserviently; he was never quite at his
ease in Challis&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Rari nantes in gurgite
vasto,&rdquo; was the tag he found in answer to the question put.
However great his contempt for Challis&rsquo;s way of life, in his
presence Crashaw was often oppressed with a feeling of inferiority, a
feeling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>which he fought against but could not subdue. The
Latin tag was an attempt to win appreciation, it represented a boast of
equality.</p>
<p class="par">Challis correctly evaluated the rector&rsquo;s attitude;
it was with something of pity in his mind that he turned and walked
beside him.</p>
<p class="par">There was but one item of news from Stoke, and it soon
came to the surface. Crashaw phrased his description of Victor Stott in
terms other than those he used in speaking to his wife or to his
parishioners; but the undercurrent of his virulent superstition did not
escape Challis, and the attitude of the villagers was made perfectly
plain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; was Challis&rsquo;s comment, when the
flow of words ceased, &ldquo;<span lang="la">nigroque simillima
cygno</span>, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! of course, you sneer at our petty
affairs,&rdquo; said Crashaw.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;By no means. I should like to see this black swan
of Stoke,&rdquo; replied Challis. &ldquo;Anything so exceptional
interests me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No doubt Mrs. Stott would be proud to exhibit the
horror,&rdquo; said Crashaw. He had a gleam of satisfaction in the
thought that even the great Henry Challis might be scared. That would,
indeed, be a triumph.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If Mrs. Stott has no objection, of course,&rdquo;
said Challis. &ldquo;Shall we go there, now?&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The visit of Henry Challis marked the first advent
of Ellen Mary&rsquo;s pride in the exhibition of her wonder. After the
King and the Royal Family&mdash;superhuman beings, infinitely
remote&mdash;the great landlord of the neighbourhood stood as a symbol
of temporal power to the whole district. The budding socialist of the
taproom might sneer, and make threat that the time was coming when he,
the boaster, and Challis, the landlord, would have equal rights; but in
public the socialist kow-towed to his master with a submission no less
obsequious than that of the humblest conservative on the estate.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Stott dropped a deep curtsy when, opening the door
to the autocratic summons of Crashaw&rsquo;s rat-a-tat, she saw the
great man of the district at her threshold. Challis raised his hat.
Crashaw did not imitate his example; he was all officiousness, he had
the air of a chief superintendent of police.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! Mrs. Stott, we should like to come in for a
few minutes. Mr. Challis would like to see your child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Damn the fool!&rdquo; was Challis&rsquo;s
thought, but he gave it less abrupt expression. &ldquo;That is, of
course, if it is quite convenient to you, Mrs. Stott. I can come at
some other time....&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Please walk in, sir,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Stott,
and curtsied again as she stood aside.</p>
<p class="par">Superintendent Crashaw led the way....</p>
<p class="par">Challis called again next day, by himself this time; and
the day after he dropped in at six o&rsquo;clock while Mr. and Mrs.
Stott were at tea. He put them at their ease by some magic of his
personality, and insisted that they should continue their meal while he
sat among the collapsed springs of the horsehair armchair. He leaned
forward and swung his stick between his knees as it were a pendulum,
and shot out questions as to the Stotts&rsquo; relations with the
neighbours. And always he had an attentive eye on the cradle that stood
near the fire.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The neighbours are not highly intelligent, I
suspect,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;Even Mr. Crashaw, I fancy, does
not appreciate the&mdash;peculiarities of the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s worse than any,&rdquo; interpolated
Stott. Ellen Mary sat in shadow; there was a new light in her eyes, a
foretaste of glory.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! a little narrow, a little dogmatic, no
doubt,&rdquo; replied Challis. &ldquo;I was going to propose that you
might prefer to live at Pym.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Much farther for me,&rdquo; muttered Stott. He
had mixed with nobility on the cricket field, and was not overawed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No doubt; but you have other interests to
consider, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>interests of far greater importance.&rdquo;
Challis shifted his gaze from the cradle, and looked Stott in the face.
&ldquo;I understand that Mrs. Stott does not care to take her child out
in the village. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Ellen, to whom this
question was addressed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to make an exhibition
of &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite right, quite right,&rdquo; went on Challis,
&ldquo;but it is very necessary that the child should have air. I
consider it very necessary, a matter of the first importance that the
child should have air,&rdquo; he repeated. His gaze had shifted back to
the cradle again. The child lay with open eyes, staring up at the
ceiling.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now, there is an excellent cottage at Pym which I
will have put in repair for you at once,&rdquo; continued Challis.
&ldquo;It is one of two together, but next door there are only old
Metcalfe and his wife and daughter, who will give you no trouble. And
really, Mrs. Stott,&rdquo; he tore his regard from the cradle for a
moment, &ldquo;there is no reason in the world why you should fear the
attention of your neighbours. Here, in Stoke, I admit, they have been
under a complete misapprehension, but I fancy that there were special
reasons for that. In Pym you will have few neighbours, and you need
not, I&rsquo;m sure, fear their criticism.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They got one idiot there, already,&rdquo; Stott
remarked somewhat sulkily.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You surely do not regard your own child as likely
to develop into an idiot, Stott!&rdquo; Challis&rsquo;s tone was one of
rebuke.</p>
<p class="par">Stott shifted in his chair and his eyes flickered
uncertainly in the direction of the cradle. &ldquo;Dr. O&rsquo;Connell
says &rsquo;twill,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When did he see the child last?&rdquo; asked
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not since &rsquo;twere a week old, sir,&rdquo;
replied Ellen.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In that case his authority goes for nothing, and,
then, by the way, I suppose the child has not been
vaccinated?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not yet, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Better have that done. Get Walters. I&rsquo;ll
make myself responsible. I&rsquo;ll get him to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Before Challis left, it was decided that the Stotts
should move to Pym in February.</p>
<p class="par">When the great landowner had gone, Mrs. Stott looked
wistfully at her husband.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t fair to the child, George,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than you or any one sees, more than
Mr. Challis, even.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Stott stared moodily into the fire.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And it won&rsquo;t be so out of the way far for
you, at Pym, with your bike,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;and we
<i>can&rsquo;t</i> stop &rsquo;ere.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We might &rsquo;a took a place in
Ailesworth,&rdquo; said Stott.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll be so much &rsquo;ealthier for
&rsquo;im up at Pym,&rdquo; protested Ellen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine
air up there for &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! <i>&rsquo;im</i>. Yes, all right for
<i>&rsquo;im</i>,&rdquo; said Stott, and spat into the fire. Then he
took his cap and went out. He kept his eyes away from the cradle.</p>

<p class="par first">Harvey Walters lived in Wenderby, but his
consulting-rooms were in Harley Street, and he did not practise in his
own neighbourhood; nevertheless he vaccinated Victor Stott to oblige
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Challis a few days later,
&ldquo;what do you make of him, Walters? No clich&eacute;s, now, and no
professional jargon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Candidly, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied
Walters, after a thoughtful interval.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How many times have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Four, altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good patient? Healthy flesh and that sort of
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Splendid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did he look you in the eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Once, only once, the first time I visited the
house.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Challis nodded. &ldquo;My own experience, exactly. And
did you return that look of his?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not willingly. It was, I confess, not altogether
a pleasant experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis was silent for a few moments, and it was Walters
who took up the interrogatory.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Challis!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you, now, some feeling of, shall I say,
distaste for the child? Do you feel that you have no wish to see it
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is it that exactly?&rdquo; parried Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If not, what is it?&rdquo; asked Walters.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In my own case,&rdquo; said Challis, &ldquo;I can
find an analogy only in my attitude towards my &lsquo;head&rsquo; at
school. In his presence I was always intimidated by my consciousness of
his superior learning. I felt unpleasantly ignorant, small, negligible.
Curiously enough, I see something of the same expression of feeling in
the attitude of that feeble Crashaw to myself. Well, one makes an
attempt at self-assertion, a kind of futile bragging; and one knows the
futility of it&mdash;at the time. But, afterwards, one finds excuse and
seeks to belittle the personality and attainment of the person one
feared. At school we did not love the &lsquo;head,&rsquo; and, as
schoolboys will, we were always trying to run him down. &lsquo;Next
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>time he rags me, I&rsquo;ll cheek him,&rsquo; was
our usual boast&mdash;but we never did. Let&rsquo;s be honest, Walters,
are not you and I exhibiting much the same attitude towards this
extraordinary child? Didn&rsquo;t he produce the effect upon you that
I&rsquo;ve described? Didn&rsquo;t you have a little of the
&lsquo;fifth form&rsquo; feeling,&mdash;a boy under
examination?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Walters smiled and screwed his mouth on one side.
&ldquo;The thing is so absurd,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That is what we used to say at school,&rdquo;
replied Challis.</p>

<p class="par first">The Stotts&rsquo; move to Pym was not marked by
any incident. Mrs. Stott and her boy were not unduly stared upon as
they left Stoke&mdash;the children were in school&mdash;and their entry
into the new cottage was uneventful.</p>
<p class="par">They moved on a Thursday. On Sunday morning they had
their first visitor.</p>
<p class="par">He came mooning round the fence that guarded the
Stotts&rsquo; garden from the little lane&mdash;it was hardly more than
a footpath. He had a great shapeless head that waggled heavily on his
shoulders, his eyes were lustreless, and his mouth hung open,
frequently his tongue lagged out. He made strange, inhuman noises.
&ldquo;A-ba-ba,&rdquo; was his nearest approach to speech. <span class=

<p class="par">&ldquo;Now, George,&rdquo; called Mrs. Stott,

round &rsquo;ere?&rdquo; replied Stott, disregarding the comparison.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, get off,&rdquo; he called, and he went into the
garden and picked up a stick.</p>

<p class="par first">The strongest of all habits is that of
acquiescence. It is this habit of submission which explains the admired
patience and long-suffering of the abjectly poor. The lower the
individual falls, the more unconquerable becomes the inertia of mind
which interferes between him and revolt against his condition. All the
miseries of the flesh, even starvation, seem preferable to the making
of an effort great enough to break this habit of submission.</p>
<p class="par">Ginger Stott was not poor. For a man in his station of
life he was unusually well provided for, but in him the habit of
acquiescence was strongly rooted. Before his son was a year old, Stott
had grown to loathe his home, to dread his return to it, yet it did not
occur to him until another year had passed that he could, if he would,
set up another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>establishment on his own account; that he could,
for instance, take a room in Ailesworth, and leave his wife and child
in the cottage. For two years he did not begin to think of this idea,
and then it was suddenly forced upon him.</p>
<p class="par">Ever since they had overheard those strangely
intelligent self-communings, the Stotts had been perfectly aware that
their wonderful child could talk if he would. Ellen Mary, pondering
that single expression, had read a world of meaning into her
son&rsquo;s murmurs of &ldquo;learning.&rdquo; In her simple mind she
understood that his deliberate withholding of speech was a reserve
against some strange manifestation.</p>
<p class="par">The manifestation, when it came, was as remarkable as it
was unexpected.</p>
<p class="par">The arm-chair in which Henry Challis had once sat was a
valued possession, dedicated by custom to the sole use of George Stott.
Ever since he had been married, Stott had enjoyed the full and
undisputed use of that chair. Except at his meals, he never sat in any
other, and he had formed a fixed habit of throwing himself into that
chair immediately on his return from his work at the County Ground.</p>
<p class="par">One evening in November, however, when his son was just
over two years old, Stott found his sacred chair occupied. He hesitated
a moment, and then went in to the kitchen to find his wife.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That child&rsquo;s in my chair,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen was setting the tray for her husband&rsquo;s tea.
&ldquo;Yes ... I know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I&mdash;I did mention
it, but &rsquo;e &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t moved.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, take &rsquo;im out,&rdquo; ordered Stott,
but he dropped his voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo; asked his wife.
&ldquo;Tea&rsquo;s just ready. Time that&rsquo;s done &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll
be ready for &rsquo;is bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you move &rsquo;im?&rdquo;
persisted Stott gloomily. &ldquo;&rsquo;E knows it&rsquo;s my
chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There! kettle&rsquo;s boilin&rsquo;, come in and
&rsquo;ave your tea,&rdquo; equivocated the diplomatic Ellen.</p>
<p class="par">During the progress of the meal, the child still sat
quietly in his father&rsquo;s chair, his little hands resting on his
knees, his eyes wide open, their gaze abstracted, as usual, from all
earthly concerns.</p>
<p class="par">But after tea Stott was heroic. He had reached the limit
of his endurance. One of his deep-seated habits was being broken, and
with it snapped his habit of acquiescence. He rose to his feet and
faced his son with determination, and Stott had a bull-dog quality
about him that was not easily defeated.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere! Get out!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>my</i> chair!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The child very deliberately withdrew his attention from
infinity and regarded the dogged face and set jaw of his father. Stott
returned the stare for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>fraction of a second, and then his
eyes wavered and dropped, but he maintained his resolution.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You got to get out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or
I&rsquo;ll lift you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary gripped the edge of the table, but she made
no attempt to interfere.</p>
<p class="par">There was a tense, strained silence. Then Stott began to
breathe heavily. He lifted his long arms for a moment and raised his
eyes, he even made a tentative step towards the usurped chair.</p>
<p class="par">The child sat calm, motionless; his eyes were fixed upon
his father&rsquo;s face with a sublime, unalterable confidence.</p>
<p class="par">Stott&rsquo;s arms fell to his sides again, he shuffled
his feet. One more effort he made, a sudden, vicious jerk, as though he
would do the thing quickly and be finished with it; then he shivered,
his resolution broke, and he shambled evasively to the door.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;God damn,&rdquo; he muttered. At the door he
turned for an instant, swore again in the same words, and went out into
the night.</p>
<p class="par">To Stott, moodily pacing the Common, this thing was
incomprehensible, some horrible infraction of the law of normal life,
something to be condemned; altered, if possible. It was unprecedented,
and it was, therefore, wrong, unnatural, diabolic, a violation of the
sound principles which uphold human society. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">To Ellen Mary it was merely a miracle, the foreshadowing
of greater miracles to come. And to her was manifested, also, a minor
miracle, for when his father had gone, the child looked at his mother
and gave out his first recorded utterance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo <i>is</i> God?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary tried to explain, but before she had
stammered out many words, her son abstracted his gaze, climbed down out
of the chair, and intimated with his usual grunt that he desired his
bath and his bed.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The depths of Stott were stirred that night. He
had often said that &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t stand it much
longer,&rdquo; but the words were a mere formula: he had never even
weighed their intention. As he paced the Common, he muttered them again
to the night, with new meaning; he saw new possibilities, and saw that
they were practicable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad enough,&rdquo; was
his new phrase, and he added another that evidenced his new attitude.
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said again and again. &ldquo;And why
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Stott&rsquo;s mind was not analytical. He did not
examine his problem, weigh this and that and draw a balanced deduction.
He merely saw a picture of peace and quiet, in a room at Ailesworth, in
convenient <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>proximity to his work (he made an admirable
groundsman and umpire, his work absorbed him) and, perhaps, he
conceived some dim ideal of pleasant evenings spent in the
companionship of those who thought in the same terms as himself; whose
speech was of form, averages, the preparation of wickets, and all the
detail of cricket; who shared in his one interest.</p>
<p class="par">Stott&rsquo;s ambition to have a son and to teach him
the mysteries of his father&rsquo;s success had been dwindling for some
time past. On this night it was finally put aside. Stott&rsquo;s
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad enough&rdquo; may be taken to include that
frustrated ideal. No more experiments for him, was the pronouncement
that summed up his decision.</p>
<p class="par">Still there were difficulties. Economically he was free,
he could allow his wife thirty shillings a week, more than enough for
her support and that of her child; but&mdash;what would she say, how
would she take his determination? A determination it was, not a
proposal. And the neighbours, what would they say? Stott anticipated a
fuss. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;ve married &rsquo;er, and
it&rsquo;s my duty to stay by &rsquo;er,&rdquo; was his anticipation of
his wife&rsquo;s attitude. He did not profess to understand the ways of
the sex, but some rumours of misunderstandings between husbands and
wives of his own class had filtered through his absorption in cricket.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">He stumbled home with a mind prepared for
dissension.</p>
<p class="par">He found his wife stitching by the fire. The door at the
foot of the stairs was closed. The room presented an aspect of cleanly,
cheerful comfort; but Stott entered with dread, not because he feared
to meet his wife, but because there was a terror sleeping in that
house.</p>
<p class="par">His armchair was empty now, but he hesitated before he
sat down in it. He took off his cap and rubbed the seat and back of the
chair vigorously: a child of evil had polluted it, the chair might
still hold enchantment....</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad enough,&rdquo; was his
preface, and there was no need for any further explanation.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary let her hands fall into her lap, and stared
dreamily at the fire.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s come to this,
George,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t been my fault
no more&rsquo;n it&rsquo;s been your&rsquo;n. Of course I&rsquo;ve seen
it a-comin&rsquo;, and I knowed it <i>&rsquo;ad</i> to be, some time;
but I don&rsquo;t think there need be any &rsquo;ard words over it. I
don&rsquo;t expec&rsquo; you to understand &rsquo;im, no more&rsquo;n I
do myself&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t in nature as you should, but all said
and done, there&rsquo;s no bones broke, and if we &rsquo;ave to part,
there&rsquo;s no reason as we shouldn&rsquo;t part
peaceable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">That speech said nearly everything. Afterwards
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>it was only a question of making arrangements,
and in that there was no difficulty.</p>
<p class="par">Another man might have felt a little hurt, a little
neglected by the absence of any show of feeling on his wife&rsquo;s
part, but Stott passed it by. He was singularly free from all
sentimentality; certain primitive, human emotions seem to have played
no part in his character. At this moment he certainly had no thought
that he was being carelessly treated; he wanted to be free from the
oppression of that horror upstairs&mdash;so he figured it&mdash;and the
way was made easy for him.</p>
<p class="par">He nodded approval, and made no sign of any feeling.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall go to-morrer,&rdquo; he said, and then,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep down &rsquo;ere to-night.&rdquo; He indicated
the sofa upon which he had slept for so many nights at Stoke, after his
tragedy had been born to him.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary had said nearly everything, but when she had
made up a bed for her husband in the sitting-room, she paused, candle
in hand, before she bade him good-night.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wish &rsquo;im &rsquo;arm,
George,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s different from us, and
we don&rsquo;t understand &rsquo;im proper, but some
day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish &rsquo;im no
&rsquo;arm,&rdquo; replied Stott, and shuddered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
wish &rsquo;im no &rsquo;arm,&rdquo; he repeated, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>as
he kicked off the boot he had been unlacing.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You mayn&rsquo;t never see &rsquo;im
again,&rdquo; added Ellen Mary.</p>
<p class="par">Stott stood upright. In his socks, he looked noticeably
shorter than his wife. &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; he said, and gave a
deep sigh of relief. &ldquo;Well, thank Gawd for that,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary drew her lips together. For some dim,
unrealised reason, she wished her husband to leave the cottage with a
feeling of goodwill towards the child, but she saw that her wish was
little likely to be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, good-night, George,&rdquo; she said, after
a few seconds of silence, and she added pathetically, as she turned at
the foot of the stairs: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wish &rsquo;im no
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was all the assurance she
received.</p>
<p class="par">When she had gone, and the door was closed behind her,
Stott padded silently to the window and looked out. A young moon was
dipping into a bank of cloud, and against the feeble brightness he
could see an uncertain outline of bare trees. He pulled the curtain
across the window, and turned back to the warm cheerfulness of the
room.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t never see &rsquo;im again,&rdquo; he
murmured, &ldquo;thank Gawd!&rdquo; He undressed quietly, blew out the
lamp and got between the sheets of his improvised <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>bed.
For some minutes he stared at the leaping shadows on the ceiling. He
was wondering why he had ever been afraid of the child. &ldquo;After
all, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s only a blarsted freak,&rdquo; was the last
thought in his mind before he fell asleep.</p>
<p class="par">With that pronouncement Stott passes out of the history
of the Hampdenshire Wonder. He was in many ways an exceptional man, and
his name will always be associated with the splendid successes of
Hampdenshire cricket, both before and after the accident that destroyed
his career as a bowler. He was not spoiled by his triumphs: those two
years of celebrity never made Stott conceited, and there are
undoubtedly many traits in his character which call for our admiration.
He is still in his prime, an active agent in finding talent for his
county, and in developing that talent when found. Hampdenshire has
never come into the field with weak bowling, and all the credit belongs
to Ginger Stott.</p>
<p class="par">One sees that he was not able to appreciate the
wonderful gifts of his own son, but Stott was an ignorant man, and men
of intellectual attainment failed even as Stott failed in this respect.
Ginger Stott was a success in his own walk of life, and that fact
should command our admiration. It is not for us to judge whether his
attainments were more or less noble than the attainments of his son.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One morning, two days after Stott had left the
cottage, Ellen Mary was startled by the sudden entrance of her child
into the sitting-room. He toddled in hastily from the garden, and
pointed with excitement through the window.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary was frightened; she had never seen her child
other than deliberate, calm, judicial, in all his movements. In a
sudden spasm of motherly love she bent to pick him up, to caress
him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Wonder, with something that
approached disgust in his tone and attitude. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
repeated. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s &rsquo;e want &rsquo;angin&rsquo; round
&rsquo;ere? Send &rsquo;im off.&rdquo; He pointed again to the
window.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary looked out and saw a grinning, slobbering
obscenity at the gate. Stott had scared the idiot away, but in some
curious, inexplicable manner he had learned that his persecutor and
enemy had gone, and he had returned, and had made overtures to the
child that walked so sedately up and down the path of the little
garden.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary went out. &ldquo;You be off,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A-ba, a-ba-ba,&rdquo; bleated the idiot, and
pointed at the house.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Be off, I tell you!&rdquo; said Ellen Mary
fiercely. But still the idiot babbled and pointed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary stooped to pick up a stick. The idiot
blenched; he understood that movement well enough, though it was a
stone he anticipated, not a stick; with a foolish cry he dropped his
arms and slouched away down the lane. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Challis was out of England for more than three
years after that one brief intrusion of his into the affairs of Mr. and
Mrs. Stott. During the interval he was engaged upon those
investigations, the results of which are embodied in his monograph on
the primitive peoples of the Melanesian Archipelago. It may be
remembered that he followed Dr. W. H. R. Rivers&rsquo; and Dr. C. G.
Seligmann&rsquo;s inquiry into the practice and theory of native
customs. Challis developed his study more particularly with reference
to the earlier evolution of Totemism, and he was able by his patient
work among the Polynesians of Tikopia and Ontong Java, and his
comparisons of those sporadic tribes with the Papuasians of Eastern New
Guinea, to correct some of the inferences with regard to the origins of
exogamy made by Dr. J. G. Frazer in his great work on that subject,
published <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>some years before. A summary of Challis&rsquo;s
argument may be found in vol. li. of the <i>Journal of the Royal
Anthropological Institute</i>.</p>
<p class="par">When he returned to England, Challis shut himself up at
Chilborough. He had engaged a young Cambridge man, Gregory Lewes, as
his secretary and librarian, and the two devoted all their time to
planning, writing, and preparing the monograph referred to.</p>
<p class="par">In such circumstances it is hardly remarkable that
Challis should have completely forgotten the existence of the curious
child which had intrigued his interest nearly four years earlier, and
it was not until he had been back at Challis Court for more than eight
months, that the incursion of Percy Crashaw revived his memory of the
phenomenon.</p>
<p class="par">The library at Challis Court occupies a suite of three
rooms. The first and largest of the three is part of the original
structure of the house. Its primitive use had been that of a chapel, a
one-storey building jutting out from the west wing. This Challis had
converted into a very practicable library with a continuous gallery
running round at a height of seven feet from the floor, and in it he
had succeeded in arranging some 20,000 volumes. But as his store of
books grew&mdash;and at one period it had grown very rapidly&mdash;he
had been forced to build, and so he had added first one and then the
other of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>the two additional rooms which became necessary.
Outside, the wing had the appearance of an unduly elongated chapel, as
he had continued the original roof over his addition, and copied the
style of the old chapel architecture. The only external alteration he
had made had been the lowering of the sills of the windows.</p>
<p class="par">It was in the furthest of these three rooms that Challis
and his secretary worked, and it was from here that they saw the gloomy
figure of the Rev. Percy Crashaw coming up the drive.</p>
<p class="par">This was the third time he had called. His two former
visits had been unrewarded, but that morning a letter had come from
him, couched in careful phrases, the purport of which had been a
request for an interview on a &ldquo;matter of some moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis frowned, and rose from among an ordered litter
of manuscripts.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall have to see this man,&rdquo; he said to
Lewes, and strode hastily out of the library.</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw was perfunctorily apologetic, and Challis,
looking somewhat out of place, smoking a heavy wooden pipe in the
disused, bleak drawing-room, waited, almost silent, until his visitor
should come to the point.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo; ... and the&mdash;er&mdash;matter of some
moment, I mentioned,&rdquo; Crashaw mumbled on, &ldquo;is, I should
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>say, not altogether irrelevant to the work you
are at present engaged upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; commented Challis, with a lift of
his thick eyebrows, &ldquo;no Polynesians come to settle in Stoke, I
trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On broad lines, relevant on broad,
anthropological lines, I mean,&rdquo; said Crashaw.</p>
<p class="par">Challis grunted. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You may remember that
curious&mdash;er&mdash;abnormal child of the Stotts?&rdquo; asked
Crashaw.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Stotts? Wait a minute. Yes! Curious infant with
an abnormally intelligent expression and the head of a
hydrocephalic?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s development has upset
me in a most unusual way,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I must confess
that I am entirely at a loss, and I really believe that you are the
only person who can give me any intelligent assistance in the
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very good of you,&rdquo; murmured Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Crashaw, warming to his
subject and interlacing his fingers, &ldquo;I happen, by the merest
accident, I may say, to be the child&rsquo;s godfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! you have responsibilities!&rdquo; commented
Challis, with the first glint of amusement in his eyes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Crashaw, &ldquo;undoubtedly I
have.&rdquo; He leaned forward with his hands still clasped together,
and rested his forearms on his thighs. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>he talked he worked
his hands up and down from the wrists, by way of emphasis. &ldquo;I am
aware,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that on one point I can expect little
sympathy from you, but I make an appeal to you, nevertheless, as a man
of science and&mdash;and a magistrate; for ... for
assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He paused and looked up at Challis, received a nod of
encouragement and developed his grievance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I want to have the child certified as an idiot,
and sent to an asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On what grounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He is undoubtedly lacking mentally,&rdquo; said
Crashaw, &ldquo;and his influence is, or may be, malignant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; suggested Challis.</p>
<p class="par">For a few seconds Crashaw paused, intent on the pattern
of the carpet, and working his hands slowly. Challis saw that the
man&rsquo;s knuckles were white, that he was straining his hands
together.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He has denied God,&rdquo; he said at last with
great solemnity.</p>
<p class="par">Challis rose abruptly, and went over to the window; the
next words were spoken to his back.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have, myself, heard this infant of four years
use the most abhorrent blasphemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis had composed himself. &ldquo;Oh! I say;
that&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; he said as he turned towards the room again.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Crashaw&rsquo;s head was still bowed. &ldquo;And
whatever may be your own philosophic doubts,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
think you will agree with me that in such a case as this, something
should be done. To me it is horrible, most horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you give me any details?&rdquo;
asked Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They are most repugnant to me,&rdquo; answered
Crashaw.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite, quite! I understand. But if you want any
assistance.... Or do you expect me to investigate?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I thought it my duty, as his godfather, to see to
the child&rsquo;s spiritual welfare,&rdquo; said Crashaw, ignoring the
question put to him, &ldquo;although he is not, now, one of my
parishioners. I first went to Pym some few months ago, but the mother
interposed between me and the child. I was not permitted to see him. It
was not until a few weeks back that I met him&mdash;on the Common;
alone. Of course, I recognised him at once. He is quite
unmistakable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; prompted Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I spoke to him, and he replied with,
with&mdash;an abstracted air, without looking at me. He has not the
appearance in any way of a normal child. I made a few ordinary remarks
to him, and then I asked him if he knew his catechism. He replied that
he did not know the word &lsquo;catechism.&rsquo; I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>may
mention that he speaks the dialect of the common people, but he has a
much larger vocabulary. His mother has taught him to read, it
appears.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He seems to have a curiously apt
intelligence,&rdquo; interpolated Challis.</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw wrung his clasped hands and put the comment on
one side. &ldquo;I then spoke to him of some of the broad principles of
the Church&rsquo;s teaching,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;He listened
quietly, without interruption, and when I stopped, he prompted me with
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One minute!&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;Tell me;
what sort of questions? That is most important.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not remember precisely,&rdquo; returned
Crashaw, &ldquo;but one, I think, was as to the sources of the Bible. I
did not read anything beyond simple and somewhat unusual curiosity into
those questions, I may say.... I talked to him for some considerable
time&mdash;I dare say for more than an hour....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No signs of idiocy, apparently, during all
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I consider it less a case of idiocy than one of
possession, maleficent possession,&rdquo; replied Crashaw. He did not
see his host&rsquo;s grim smile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, and the blasphemy?&rdquo; prompted
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At the end of my instruction, the child, still
looking away from me, shook his head and said that what I had told him
was not true, I confess that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=
"#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>I was staggered. Possibly I lost
my temper, somewhat. I may have grown rather warm in my speech. And at
last....&rdquo; Crashaw clenched his hands and spoke in such a low
voice that Challis could hardly hear him. &ldquo;At last he turned to
me and said things which I could not possibly repeat, which I pray that
I may never hear again from the mouth of any living being.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Profanities, obscenities,
er&mdash;swear-words,&rdquo; suggested Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Blasphemy, <i>blasphemy</i>,&rdquo; cried
Crashaw. &ldquo;Oh! I wonder that I did not injure the
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis moved over to the window again. For more than a
minute there was silence in that big, neglected-looking room. Then
Crashaw&rsquo;s feelings began to find vent in words, in a long stream
of insistent asseverations, pitched on a rising note that swelled into
a diapason of indignation. He spoke of the position and power of his
Church, of its influence for good among the uneducated, agricultural
population among which he worked. He enlarged on the profound necessity
for a living religion among the poorer classes; and on the
revolutionary tendency towards socialism, which would be encouraged if
the great restraining power of a creed that enforced subservience to
temporal power was once shaken. And, at last, he brought his arguments
to a head by saying that the example of a child of four <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>years old, openly defying a minister of the
Church, and repudiating the very conception of the Deity, was an
example which might produce a profound effect upon the minds of a
slow-thinking people; that such an example might be the leaven which
would leaven the whole lump; and that for the welfare of the whole
neighbourhood it was an instant necessity that the child should be put
under restraint, his tongue bridled, and any opportunity to proclaim
his blasphemous doctrines forcibly denied to him. Long before he had
concluded, Crashaw was on his feet, pacing the room, declaiming, waving
his arms.</p>
<p class="par">Challis stood, unanswering, by the window. He did not
seem to hear; he did not even shrug his shoulders. Not till Crashaw had
brought his argument to a culmination, and boomed into a dramatic
silence, did Challis turn and look at him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you cannot confine a child in an asylum on
those grounds,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the law does not permit
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Church is above the law,&rdquo; replied
Crashaw.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not in these days,&rdquo; said Challis; &ldquo;it
is by law established!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw began to speak again, but Challis waved him
down. &ldquo;Quite, quite. I see your point,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
I must see this child myself. Believe me, I will see what can be done.
I will, at least, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122"
name="pb122">122</a>]</span>try to prevent his spreading his opinions
among the yokels.&rdquo; He smiled grimly. &ldquo;I quite agree with
you that that is a consummation which is not to be desired.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will see him soon?&rdquo; asked Crashaw.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; returned Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you will let me see you again,
afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw still hesitated for a moment. &ldquo;I might,
perhaps, come with you,&rdquo; he ventured.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On no account,&rdquo; said Challis.</p>

<p class="par first">Gregory Lewes was astonished at the long absence
of his chief; he was more astonished when his chief returned.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I want you to come up with me to Pym,
Lewes,&rdquo; said Challis; &ldquo;one of my tenants has been
confounding the rector of Stoke. It is a matter that must be attended
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lewes was a fair-haired, hard-working young man, with a
bent for science in general that had not yet crystallised into any
special study. He had a curious sense of humour, that proved something
of an obstacle in the way of specialisation. He did not take
Challis&rsquo;s speech seriously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you going as a magistrate?&rdquo; he asked;
&ldquo;or is it a matter for scientific investigation?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;Come
along!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you serious, sir?&rdquo; Lewes still
doubted.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Intensely. I&rsquo;ll explain as we go,&rdquo;
said Challis.</p>
<p class="par">It is not more than a mile and a half from Challis Court
to Pym. The nearest way is by a cart track through the beech woods,
that winds up the hill to the Common. In winter this track is almost
impassable, over boot-top in heavy mud; but the early spring had been
fairly dry, and Challis chose this route.</p>
<p class="par">As they walked, Challis went through the early history
of Victor Stott, so far as it was known to him. &ldquo;I had forgotten
the child,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I thought it would die. You see, it
is by way of being an extraordinary freak of nature. It has, or had, a
curious look of intelligence. You must remember that when I saw it, it
was only a few months old. But even then it conveyed in some
inexplicable way a sense of power. Every one felt it. There was Harvey
Walters, for instance&mdash;he vaccinated it; I made him confess that
the child made him feel like a school-boy. Only, you understand, it had
not spoken then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What conveyed that sense of power?&rdquo; asked
Lewes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The way it had of looking at you, staring you out
of countenance, sizing you up and rejecting you. It did that, I give
you my word; it did all that at a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124"
href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>few months old, and without
the power of speech. Only, you see, I thought it was merely a freak of
some kind, some abnormality that disgusted one in an unanalysed way.
And I thought it would die. I certainly thought it would die. I am most
eager to see this new development.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard. It confounded Crashaw, you
say? And it cannot be more than four or five years old now?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Four; four and a half,&rdquo; returned Challis,
and then the conversation was interrupted by the necessity of skirting
a tiny morass of wet leaf-mould that lay in a hollow.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Confounded Crashaw? I should think so,&rdquo;
Challis went on, when they had found firm going again. &ldquo;The good
man would not soil his devoted tongue by any condescension to oratio
recta, but I gathered that the child had made light of his divine
authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Great C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; ejaculated Lewes;
&ldquo;but that is immense. What did Crashaw do&mdash;shake
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No; he certainly did not lay hands on him at all.
His own expression was that he did not know how it was he did not do
the child an injury. That is one of the things that interest me
enormously. That power I spoke of must have been retained. Crashaw must
have been blue with anger; he could hardly repeat the story to me, he
was so agitated. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"
name="pb125">125</a>]</span>It would have surprised me less if he had
told me he had murdered the child. That I could have understood,
perfectly!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is, of course, quite incomprehensible to me,
as yet,&rdquo; commented Lewes.</p>
<p class="par">When they came out of the woods on to the stretch of
common from which you can see the great swelling undulations of the
Hampden Hills, Challis stopped. A spear of April sunshine had pierced
the load of cloud towards the west, and the bank of wood behind them
gave shelter from the cold wind that had blown fiercely all the
afternoon.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is a fine prospect,&rdquo; said Challis, with
a sweep of his hand. &ldquo;I sometimes feel, Lewes, that we are
over-intent on our own little narrow interests. Here are you and I,
busying ourselves in an attempt to throw some little light&mdash;a very
little it must be&mdash;on some petty problems of the origin of our
race. We are looking downwards, downwards always; digging in old
muck-heaps; raking up all kinds of unsavoury rubbish to prove that we
are born out of the dirt. And we have never a thought for the future in
all our work,&mdash;a future that may be glorious, who knows? Here,
perhaps in this village, insignificant from most points of view, but
set in a country that should teach us to raise our eyes from the
ground; here, in this tiny hamlet, is living a child who may become a
greater than Socrates or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href=
"#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>Shakespeare, a child who may
revolutionise our conceptions of time and space. There have been great
men in the past who have done that, Lewes; there is no reason for us to
doubt that still greater men may succeed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No; there is no reason for us to doubt
that,&rdquo; said Lewes, and they walked on in silence towards the
Stotts&rsquo; cottage.</p>

<p class="par first">Challis knocked and walked in. They found Ellen
Mary and her son at the tea-table.</p>
<p class="par">The mother rose to her feet and dropped a respectful
curtsy. The boy glanced once at Gregory Lewes and then continued his
meal as if he were unaware of any strange presence in the room.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I am afraid we are interrupting
you,&rdquo; Challis apologised. &ldquo;Pray sit down, Mrs. Stott, and
go on with your tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Thank you, sir. I&rsquo;d just finished,
sir,&rdquo; said Ellen Mary, and remained standing with an air of quiet
deference.</p>
<p class="par">Challis took the celebrated armchair, and motioned Lewes
to the window-sill, the nearest available seat for him. &ldquo;Please
sit down, Mrs. Stott,&rdquo; he said, and Ellen Mary sat,
apologetically.</p>
<p class="par">The boy pushed his cup towards his mother, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>pointed to the teapot; he made a grunting sound
to attract her attention.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir,&rdquo; murmured
Ellen Mary, and she refilled the cup and passed it back to her son, who
received it without any acknowledgment. Challis and Lewes were
observing the boy intently, but he took not the least notice of their
scrutiny. He discovered no trace of self-consciousness; Henry Challis
and Gregory Lewes appeared to have no place in the world of his
abstraction.</p>
<p class="par">The figure the child presented to his two observers was
worthy of careful scrutiny.</p>
<p class="par">At the age of four and a half years, the Wonder was
bald, save for a few straggling wisps of reddish hair above the ears
and at the base of the skull, and a weak, sparse down, of the same
colour, on the crown. The eyebrows, too, were not marked by any line of
hair, but the eyelashes were thick, though short, and several shades
darker than the hair on the skull.</p>
<p class="par">The face is not so easily described. The mouth and chin
were relatively small, overshadowed by that broad cliff of forehead,
but they were firm, the chin well moulded, the lips thin and
compressed. The nose was unusual when seen in profile. There was no
sign of a bony bridge, but it was markedly curved and jutted out at a
curious angle from the line of the face. The nostrils were wide and
open. None <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>of these features produced any effect of
childishness; but this effect was partly achieved by the contours of
the cheeks, and by the fact that there was no indication of any lines
on the face.</p>
<p class="par">The eyes nearly always wore their usual expression of
abstraction. It was very rarely that the Wonder allowed his
intelligence to be exhibited by that medium. When he did, the effect
was strangely disconcerting, blinding. One received an impression of
extraordinary concentration: it was as though for an instant the boy
was able to give one a glimpse of the wonderful force of his intellect.
When he looked one in the face with intention, and suddenly allowed one
to realise, as it were, all the dominating power of his brain, one
shrank into insignificance, one felt as an ignorant, intelligent man
may feel when confronted with some elaborate theorem of the higher
mathematics. &ldquo;Is it possible that any one can really understand
these things?&rdquo; such a man might think with awe, and in the same
way one apprehended some vast, inconceivable possibilities of
mind-function when the Wonder looked at one with, as I have said,
intention.</p>
<p class="par">He was dressed in a little jacket-suit, and wore a linen
collar; the knickerbockers, loose and badly cut, fell a little below
the knees. His stockings were of worsted, his boots clumsy and
thick-soled, though relatively tiny. One had the impression always that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>his body was fragile and small, but as a matter
of fact the body and limbs were, if anything, slightly better developed
than those of the average child of four and a half years.</p>
<p class="par">Challis had ample opportunity to make these observations
at various periods. He began them as he sat in the Stotts&rsquo;
cottage. At first he did not address the boy directly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I hear your son has been having a religious
controversy with Mr. Crashaw,&rdquo; was his introduction to the object
of his visit.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Indeed, sir!&rdquo; Plainly this was not news to
Mrs. Stott.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your son told you?&rdquo; suggested Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! no, sir, &rsquo;e never told me,&rdquo;
replied Mrs. Stott, &ldquo;&rsquo;twas Mr. Crashaw. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s
been &rsquo;ere several times lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis looked sharply at the boy, but he gave no sign
that he heard what was passing.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes; Mr. Crashaw seems rather upset about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes; speak plainly,&rdquo; prompted Challis.
&ldquo;I assure you, that you will have no cause to regret any
confidence you may make to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see as it&rsquo;s any business of
Mr. Crashaw&rsquo;s, sir, if you&rsquo;ll forgive me for sayin&rsquo;
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He has been worrying you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;E &rsquo;as, sir, but &rsquo;e ... &rdquo;
she glanced at her son&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>she laid a stress on the pronoun
always when she spoke of him that differentiated its
significance&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;e &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t seen Mr. Crashaw
again, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis turned to the boy. &ldquo;You are not interested
in Mr. Crashaw, I suppose?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">The boy took no notice of the question.</p>
<p class="par">Challis was piqued. If this extraordinary child really
had an intelligence, surely it must be possible to appeal to that
intelligence in some way. He made another effort, addressing Mrs.
Stott.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think we must forgive Mr. Crashaw, you know,
Mrs. Stott. As I understand it, your boy at the age of four years and a
half has defied&mdash;his cloth, if I may say so.&rdquo; He paused, and
as he received no answer, continued: &ldquo;But I hope that matter may
be easily arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stott.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you. I&rsquo;m sure, I&rsquo;m greatly
obliged to you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only one reason of my visit to you,
however.&rdquo; Challis hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering
whether I might not be able to help you and your son in some other way.
I understand that he has unusual power of&mdash;of
intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Indeed &rsquo;e &rsquo;as, sir,&rdquo; responded
Mrs. Stott.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And he can read, can&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned &rsquo;im what I could, sir:
it isn&rsquo;t much.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, perhaps I could lend him a few
books.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Challis made a significant pause, and again he looked at
the boy; but there was no response, so he continued: &ldquo;Tell me
what he has read.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no books, sir, and we never
&rsquo;ardly see a paper now. All we &rsquo;ave in the &rsquo;ouse is a
Bible and two copies of Lillywhite&rsquo;s cricket annual as my
&rsquo;usband left be&rsquo;ind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis smiled. &ldquo;Has he read those?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Bible &rsquo;e &rsquo;as, I believe,&rdquo;
replied Mrs. Stott.</p>
<p class="par">It was a conversation curious in its impersonality.
Challis was conscious of the anomaly that he was speaking in the
boy&rsquo;s presence, crediting him with a remarkable intelligence, and
yet addressing a frankly ignorant woman as though the boy was not in
the room. Yet how could he break that deliberate silence? It seemed to
him as though there must, after all, be some mistake; yet how account
for Crashaw&rsquo;s story if the boy were indeed an idiot?</p>
<p class="par">With a slight show of temper he turned to the
Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you want to read?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I
have between forty and fifty thousand books in my library. I think it
possible that you might find one or two which would interest
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder lifted his hand as though to ask for silence.
For a minute, perhaps, no one spoke. All <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>waited, expectant;
Challis and Lewes with intent eyes fixed on the detached expression of
the child&rsquo;s face, Ellen Mary with bent head. It was a strange,
yet very logical question that came at last:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What should I learn out of all them books?&rdquo;
asked the Wonder. He did not look at Challis as he spoke.</p>
</div>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">IV</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Challis drew a deep breath and looked at
Lewes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A difficult question, that, Lewes,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p class="par">Lewes lifted his eyebrows and pulled at his fair
moustache. &ldquo;If you take the question literally,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You might learn&mdash;the essential part ... of
all the knowledge that has been ... discovered by mankind,&rdquo; said
Challis. He phrased his sentence carefully, as though he were afraid of
being trapped.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Should I learn what I am?&rdquo; asked the
Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">Challis understood the question in its metaphysical
acceptation. He had the sense of a powerful but undirected intelligence
working from the simple <span class="corr" id="xd22e2327" title=
"Source: premisses">premises</span> of experience; of a cloistered mind
that had functioned profoundly; a mind unbound by the tradition of all
the speculations and discoveries of man, the essential conclusions of
which were contained in that library at Challis Court.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Challis, after a perceptible
interval, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>&ldquo;that you will not learn from any books in
my possession, but you will find grounds for speculation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Grounds for speculation?&rdquo; questioned the
Wonder. He repeated the words quite clearly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Material&mdash;matter from which you
can&mdash;er&mdash;formulate theories of your own,&rdquo; explained
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder shook his head. It was evident that
Challis&rsquo;s sentence conveyed little or no meaning to him.</p>
<p class="par">He got down from his chair and took up an old cricket
cap of his father&rsquo;s, a cap which his mother had let out by the
addition of another gore of cloth that did not match the original
material. He pulled this cap carefully over his bald head, and then
made for the door.</p>
<p class="par">At the threshold the strange child paused, and without
looking at any one present said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll coom to your
library,&rdquo; and went out.</p>
<p class="par">Challis joined Lewes at the window, and they watched the
boy make his deliberate way along the garden path and up the lane
towards the fields beyond.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You let him go out by himself?&rdquo; asked
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He likes to be in the air, sir,&rdquo; replied
Ellen Mary.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I suppose you have to let him go his own
way?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will send the governess cart up for him
to-morrow morning,&rdquo; said Challis, &ldquo;at ten o&rsquo;clock.
That is, of course, if you have no objection to his coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;E said &rsquo;e&rsquo;d coom, sir,&rdquo;
replied Ellen Mary. Her tone implied that there was no appeal possible
against her son&rsquo;s statement of his wishes.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;His methods do not lack terseness,&rdquo;
remarked Lewes, when he and Challis were out of earshot of the
cottage.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His methods and manners are damnable,&rdquo; said
Challis, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You were going to say?&rdquo; prompted Lewes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, what is your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am not convinced, as yet,&rdquo; said
Lewes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, surely,&rdquo; expostulated Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not from objective, personal evidence. Let us put
Crashaw out of our minds for the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very well; go on, state your case.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He has, so far, made four remarks in our
presence,&rdquo; said Lewes, gesticulating with his walking stick.
&ldquo;Two of them can be neglected; his repetition of your words,
which he did not understand, and his condescending promise to study
your library.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m with you, so far.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now, putting aside the preconception with which
we entered the cottage, was there really anything in the other two
remarks? Were they not the type of simple, unreasoning questions which
one may often hear from the mouth of a child of that age? &lsquo;What
shall I learn from your books?&rsquo; Well, it is the natural question
of the ignorant child, who has no conception of the contents of books,
no experience which would furnish material for his
imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The second remark is more explicable still. It is
a remark we all make in childhood, in some form or another. I remember
quite well at the age of six or seven asking my mother: &lsquo;Which is
me, my soul or my body?&rsquo; I was brought up on the Church
catechism. But you at once accepted these questions&mdash;which, I
maintain, were questions possible in the mouth of a simple, ignorant
child&mdash;in some deep, metaphysical acceptation. Don&rsquo;t you
think, sir, we should wait for further evidence before we attribute any
phenomenal intelligence to this child?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite the right attitude to take, Lewes&mdash;the
scientific attitude,&rdquo; replied Challis. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go by
the lane,&rdquo; he added, as they reached the entrance to the
wood.</p>
<p class="par">For some few minutes they walked in silence; Challis
with his head down, his heavy shoulders <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>humped. His hands
were clasped behind him, dragging his stick as it were a tail, which he
occasionally cocked. He walked with a little stumble now and again, his
eyes on the ground. Lewes strode with a sure foot, his head up, and he
slashed at the tangle of last year&rsquo;s growth on the bank whenever
he passed some tempting butt for the sword-play of his stick.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you think, then,&rdquo; said Challis at last,
&ldquo;that much of the atmosphere&mdash;you must have marked the
atmosphere&mdash;of the child&rsquo;s personality, was a creation of
our own minds, due to our preconceptions?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, I think so,&rdquo; Lewes replied, a touch of
defiance in his tone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what you <i>want</i> to
believe?&rdquo; asked Challis.</p>
<p class="par">Lewes hit at a flag of dead bracken and missed.
&ldquo;You mean...?&rdquo; he prevaricated.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I mean that that is a much stronger influence
than any preconception, my dear Lewes. I&rsquo;m no pragmatist, as you
know; but there can be no doubt that with the majority of us the wish
to believe a thing is true constitutes the truth of that thing for us.
And that is, in my opinion, the wrong attitude for either scientist or
philosopher. Now, in the case we are discussing, I suppose, at bottom I
should like to agree with you. One does not like to feel that a child
of four and a half has greater intellectual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>powers than oneself. Candidly, I do not like it
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Of course not! But I can&rsquo;t think
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You can if you try; you would at once if you
wished to,&rdquo; returned Challis, anticipating the completion of
Lewes&rsquo;s sentence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that there are some remarkable
facts in the case of this child,&rdquo; said Lewes, &ldquo;but I do not
see why we should, as yet, take the whole proposition for
granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No! I am with you there,&rdquo; returned Challis.
And no more was said until they were nearly home.</p>
<p class="par">Just before they turned into the drive, however, Challis
stopped. &ldquo;Do you know, Lewes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not
sure that I am doing a wise thing in bringing that child
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lewes did not understand. &ldquo;No, sir? Why
not?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why, think of the possibilities of that child, if
he has all the powers I credit him with,&rdquo; said Challis.
&ldquo;Think of his possibilities for original thought if he is kept
away from all the traditions of this futile learning.&rdquo; He waved
an arm in the direction of the elongated chapel.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! but surely,&rdquo; remonstrated Lewes,
&ldquo;that is a necessary groundwork. Knowledge is built up step by
step.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is it? I wonder. I sometimes doubt,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>Challis. &ldquo;Yes, I sometimes doubt whether
we have ever learned anything at all that is worth knowing. And,
perhaps, this child, if he were kept away from books.... However, the
thing is done now, and in any case he would never have been able to
dodge the School attendance officer.&rdquo; <span class=

<p class="par first">&ldquo;Shall you be able to help me in collating
your notes of the Tikopia observations this morning, sir?&rdquo; Lewes
asked. He rose from the breakfast-table and lit a cigarette. There was
no ceremony between Challis and his secretary.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You forget our engagement for ten
o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Need that distract us?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It need not, but doesn&rsquo;t it seem to you
that it may furnish us with valuable material?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hardly pertinent, sir, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What line do you think of taking up,
Lewes?&rdquo; asked Challis with apparent irrelevance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;With regard to this&mdash;this
phenomenon?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, no. I was speaking of your own
ambitions.&rdquo; Challis had sauntered over to the window; he stood,
with his back to Lewes, looking out at the blue and white of the April
sky. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Lewes frowned. He did not understand the gist of the
question. &ldquo;I suppose there is a year&rsquo;s work on this book
before me yet,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; replied Challis, watching a
cloud shadow swarm up the slope of Deane Hill. &ldquo;Yes, certainly a
year&rsquo;s work. I was thinking of the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have thought of laboratory work in connection
with psychology,&rdquo; said Lewes, still puzzled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I thought I remembered your saying something of
the kind,&rdquo; murmured Challis absently. &ldquo;We are going to have
more rain. It will be a late spring this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Had the question any bearing on our engagement of
this morning?&rdquo; Lewes was a little anxious, uncertain whether this
inquiry as to his future had not some particular significance; a hint,
perhaps, that his services would not be required much longer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes; I think it had,&rdquo; said Challis.
&ldquo;I saw the governess cart go up the road a few minutes
since.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I suppose the boy will be here in a quarter of an
hour?&rdquo; said Lewes by way of keeping up the conversation. He was
puzzled; he did not know Challis in this mood. He did not conceive it
possible that Challis could be nervous about the arrival of so
insignificant a person as this Stott child.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very ridiculous,&rdquo; broke out
Challis suddenly; and he turned away from the window, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>and
joined Lewes by the fire. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t follow you,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;I was a trifle inconsecutive. But I wish you were more
interested in this child, Lewes. The thought of him engrosses me, and
yet I don&rsquo;t want to meet him. I should be relieved to hear that
he wasn&rsquo;t coming. Surely you, as a student of psychology
...&rdquo; he broke off with a lift of his heavy shoulders.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! Yes! I <i>am</i> interested, certainly, as
you say, as a student of psychology. We ought to take some
measurements. The configuration of the skull is not abnormal otherwise
than in its relation to the development of the rest of his body, but
...&rdquo; Lewes meandered off into somewhat abstruse speculation with
regard to the significance of craniology.</p>
<p class="par">Challis nodded his head and murmured: &ldquo;Quite,
quite,&rdquo; occasionally. He seemed glad that Lewes should continue
to talk.</p>
<p class="par">The lecture was interrupted by the appearance of the
governess cart.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;By Jove, he <i>has</i> come,&rdquo; ejaculated
Challis in the middle of one of Lewes&rsquo;s periods.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to see me through this, my boy. I&rsquo;m
damned if I know how to take the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lewes flushed, annoyed at the interruption of his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>lecture. He had believed that he had been
interesting. &ldquo;Curse the kid,&rdquo; was the thought in his mind
as he followed Challis to the window.</p>

<p class="par first">Jessop, the groom deputed to fetch the Wonder from
Pym, looked a little uneasy, perhaps a little scared. When he drew up
at the porch, the child pointed to the door of the cart and indicated
that it was to be opened for him. He was evidently used to being waited
upon. When this command had been obeyed, he descended deliberately and
then pointed to the front door.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Open!&rdquo; he said clearly, as Jessop
hesitated. The Wonder knew nothing of bells or ceremony.</p>
<p class="par">Jessop came down from the cart and rang.</p>
<p class="par">The butler opened the door. He was an old servant and
accustomed to his master&rsquo;s eccentricities, but he was not
prepared for the vision of that strange little figure, with a large
head in a parti-coloured cricket-cap, an apparition that immediately
walked straight by him into the hall, and pointed to the first door he
came to.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, dear! Well, to be sure,&rdquo; gasped
Heathcote. &ldquo;Why, whatever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Open!&rdquo; commanded the Wonder, and Heathcote
obeyed, weak-kneed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143"
name="pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The door chanced to be the right one, the door of the
breakfast-room, and the Wonder walked in, still wearing his cap.</p>
<p class="par">Challis came forward to meet him with a conventional
greeting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you were able to come ...&rdquo; he
began, but the child took no notice; he looked rapidly round the room,
and not finding what he wanted, signified his desire by a single
word.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Books,&rdquo; he said, and looked at Challis.</p>
<p class="par">Heathcote stood at the door, hesitating between
amazement and disapproval. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen the
like,&rdquo; was how he phrased his astonishment later, in the
servants&rsquo; hall, &ldquo;never in all my born days. To see that
melon-&rsquo;eaded himp in a cricket-cap hordering the master about.
Well, there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Jessop says he fair got the creeps drivin&rsquo;
&rsquo;im over,&rdquo; said the cook. &ldquo;&rsquo;E says the
child&rsquo;s not right in &rsquo;is &rsquo;ead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Much embroidery followed in the servants&rsquo; hall.

<h2 class="main">INTERLUDE</h2>
<p class="par first">This brief history of the Hampdenshire Wonder is
marked by a stereotyped division into three parts, an arbitrary
arrangement dependent on the experience of the writer. The true
division becomes manifest at this point. The life of Victor Stott was
cut into two distinct sections, between which there is no correlation.
The first part should tell the story of his mind during the life of
experience, the time occupied in observation of the phenomena of life
presented to him in fact, without any specific teaching on the theories
of existence and progress, or on the speculation as to ultimate
destiny. The second part should deal with his entry into the world of
books; into that account of a long series of collated experiments and
partly verified hypotheses we call science; into the imperfectly
developed system of inductive and deductive logic which determines
mathematics and philosophy; into the long, inaccurate and largely
unverifiable account of human blindness and error known as history; and
into the realm of idealism, symbol, and pitiful pride we find in the
story of poetry, letters, and religion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">I will confess that I once contemplated the writing of
such a history. It was Challis who, in his courtly, gentle way, pointed
out to me that no man living had the intellectual capacity to undertake
so profound a work.</p>
<p class="par">For some three months before I had this conversation
with Challis, I had been wrapped in solitude, dreaming, speculating. I
had been uplifted in thought, I had come to believe myself inspired as
a result of my separation from the world of men, and of the deep
introspection and meditation in which I had been plunged. I had arrived
at a point, perhaps not far removed from madness, at which I thought
myself capable of setting out the true history of Victor Stott.</p>
<p class="par">Challis broke the spell. He cleared away the false
glamour which was blinding and intoxicating me, and brought me back to
a condition of open-eyed sanity. To Challis I owe a great debt.</p>
<p class="par">Yet at the moment I was sunk in depression. All the
glory of my vision had faded; the afterglow was quenched in the
blackness of the night that drew out of the east and fell from the
zenith as a curtain of utter darkness.</p>
<p class="par">Again Challis came to my rescue. He brought me a great
sheaf of notes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you
can&rsquo;t write a true history of that strange child, I see no reason
why <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>you should not write his story as it is known to
you, as it impinges on your own life. After all, you, in many ways,
know more of him than any one. You came nearest to receiving his
confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But only during the last few months,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does that matter?&rdquo; said Challis with an
upheaval of his shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;shrug&rdquo; is far too
insignificant a word for that mountainous humping. &ldquo;Is any
biography founded on better material than you have at
command?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He unfolded his bundle of notes. &ldquo;See here,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;here is some magnificent material for
you&mdash;first-hand observations made at the time. Can&rsquo;t you
construct a story from that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Even then I began to cast my story in a slightly
biographical form. I wrote half a dozen chapters, and read them to
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Magnificent, my dear fellow,&rdquo; was his
comment, &ldquo;magnificent; but no one will believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I had been carried away by my own prose, and with the
natural vanity of the author, I resented intensely his criticism.</p>
<p class="par">For some weeks I did not see Challis again, and I
persisted in my futile endeavour, but always as I wrote that killing
suggestion insinuated itself: &ldquo;No one will believe you.&rdquo; At
times I felt as a man may feel who has spent many years in a lunatic
asylum, and after his release is for ever engaged <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>in a
struggle to allay the doubts of a leering suspicion.</p>
<p class="par">I gave up the hopeless task at last, and sought out
Challis again.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Write it as a story,&rdquo; he suggested,
&ldquo;and give up the attempt to carry conviction.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">And in that spirit, adopting the form of a story, I did
begin, and in that form I hope to finish.</p>
<p class="par">But here as I reach the great division, the determining
factor of Victor Stott&rsquo;s life, I am constrained to pause and
apologise. I have become uncomfortably conscious of my own limitations,
and the feeble, ephemeral methods I am using. I am trifling with a
wonderful story, embroidering my facts with the tawdry detail of my own
imagining.</p>
<p class="par">I saw&mdash;I see&mdash;no other way.</p>
<p class="par">This is, indeed, a preface, yet I prefer to put it in
this place, since it was at this time I wrote it.</p>

<p class="par first">Challis led the way to the library; Lewes,
petulant and mutinous, hung in the rear.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder toddled forward, unabashed, to enter his new
world. On the threshold, however, he paused. His comprehensive stare
took in a sweeping picture of enclosing walls of books, and beyond was
a vista of further rooms, of more walls all lined from floor to ceiling
with records of human discovery, endeavour, doubt, and hope.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder stayed and stared. Then he took two faltering
steps into the room and stopped again, and, finally, he looked up at
Challis with doubt and question; his gaze no longer quelling and
authoritative, but hesitating, compliant, perhaps a little
childlike.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave you read all these?&rdquo; he asked.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It was a curious picture. The tall figure of Challis,
stooping, as always, slightly forward; Challis, with his seaman&rsquo;s
eyes and scholar&rsquo;s head, his hands loosely clasped together
behind his back, paying such scrupulous attention to that grotesque
representative of a higher intellectuality, clothed in the dress of a
villager, a patched cricket-cap drawn down over his globular skull, his
little arms hanging loosely at his sides; who, nevertheless, even in
this new, strange aspect of unwonted humility bore on his face the
promise of some ultimate development which differentiated him from all
other humanity, as the face of humanity is differentiated from the face
of its prognathous ancestor.</p>
<p class="par">The scene is set in a world of books, and in the
background lingers the athletic figure and fair head of Lewes, the
young Cambridge undergraduate, the disciple of science, hardly yet
across the threshold which divides him from the knowledge of his own
ignorance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave you read all these?&rdquo; asked the
Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A greater part of them&mdash;in effect,&rdquo;
replied Challis. &ldquo;There is much repetition, you understand, and
much record of experiment which becomes, in a sense, worthless when the
conclusions are either finally accepted or rejected.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The eyes of the Wonder shifted and their expression
became abstracted; he seemed to lose consciousness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>of
the outer world; he wore the look which you may see in the eyes of
Jakob Schlesinger&rsquo;s portrait of the mature Hegel, a look of
profound introspection and analysis.</p>
<p class="par">There was an interval of silence, and then the Wonder
unknowingly gave expression to a quotation from Hamlet.
&ldquo;Words,&rdquo; he whispered reflectively, and then again
&ldquo;words.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Challis understood him. &ldquo;You have not yet
learned the meaning of words?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">The brief period&mdash;the only one recorded&mdash;of
amazement and submission was over. It may be that he had doubted during
those few minutes of time whether he was well advised to enter into
that world of books, whether he would not by so doing stunt his own
mental growth. It may be that the decision of so momentous a question
should have been postponed for a year&mdash;two years; to a time when
his mind should have had further possibilities for unlettered
expansion. However that may be, he decided now and finally. He walked
to the table and climbed up on a chair.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Books about words,&rdquo; he commanded, and
pointed at Challis and Lewes.</p>
<p class="par">They brought him the latest production of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>twentieth century in many volumes, the work of a
dozen eminent authorities on the etymology of the English language, and
they seated him on eight volumes of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</i> (India paper edition) in order that he might reach the
level of the table.</p>
<p class="par">At first they tried to show him how his wonderful
dictionary should be used, but he pushed them on one side, neither then
nor at any future time would he consent to be taught&mdash;the process
was too tedious for him, his mind worked more fluently, rapidly, and
comprehensively than the mind of the most gifted teacher that could
have been found for him.</p>
<p class="par">So Challis and Lewes stood on one side and watched him,
and he was no more embarrassed by their presence than if they had been
in another world, as, possibly, they were.</p>
<p class="par">He began with volume one, and he read the title page and
the introduction, the list of abbreviations, and all the preliminary
matter in due order.</p>
<p class="par">Challis noted that when the Wonder began to read, he
read no faster than the average educated man, but that he acquired
facility at a most astounding rate, and that when he had been reading
for a few days his eye swept down the column, as it were at a single
glance.</p>
<p class="par">Challis and Lewes watched him for, perhaps, half an
hour, and then, seeing that their presence was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>of
an entirely negligible value to the Wonder, they left him and went into
the farther room.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Challis, &ldquo;what do you
make of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is he reading or pretending to read?&rdquo;
parried Lewes. &ldquo;Do you think it possible that he could read so
fast? Moreover, remember that he has admitted that he knows few words
of the English language, yet he does not refer from volume to volume;
he does not look up the meanings of the many unknown words which must
occur in every definition.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I know. I had noticed that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then you think he <i>is</i>
humbugging&mdash;pretending to read?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No; that solution seems to me altogether
unlikely. He could not, for one thing, simulate that look of attention.
Remember, Lewes, the child is not yet five years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is your explanation, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am wondering whether the child has not a memory
beside which the memory of a Macaulay would appear
insignificant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lewes did not grasp Challis&rsquo;s intention.
&ldquo;Even so ...&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Challis, &ldquo;I am
wondering whether, if that is the case, he is, in effect, prepared to
learn the whole dictionary by heart, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>and, so to speak,
collate its contents later, in his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! Sir!&rdquo; Lewes smiled. The supposition was
too outrageous to be taken seriously. &ldquo;Surely, you can&rsquo;t
mean that.&rdquo; There was something in Lewes&rsquo;s tone which
carried a hint of contempt for so far-fetched a hypothesis.</p>
<p class="par">Challis was pacing up and down the library, his hands
clasped behind him. &ldquo;Yes, I mean it,&rdquo; he said, without
looking up. &ldquo;I put it forward as a serious theory, worthy of full
consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lewes sneered. &ldquo;Oh, surely not, sir,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p class="par">Challis stopped and faced him. &ldquo;Why not, Lewes;
why not?&rdquo; he asked, with a kindly smile. &ldquo;Think of the gap
which separates your intellectual powers from those of a Polynesian
savage. Why, after all, should it be impossible that this child&rsquo;s
powers should equally transcend our own? A freak, if you will, an
abnormality, a curious effect of nature&rsquo;s, like the giant
puff-ball&mdash;but still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! yes, sir, I grant you the thing is not
impossible from a theoretical point of view,&rdquo; argued Lewes,
&ldquo;but I think you are theorising on altogether insufficient
evidence. I am willing to admit that such a freak is theoretically
possible, but I have not yet found the indications of such a power in
the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis resumed his pacing. &ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo;
he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>assented; &ldquo;your method is perfectly
correct&mdash;perfectly correct. We must wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At twelve o&rsquo;clock Challis brought a glass of milk
and some biscuits, and set them beside the Wonder&mdash;he was at the
letter &ldquo;B.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, how are you getting on?&rdquo; asked
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder took not the least notice of the question,
but he stretched out a little hand and took a biscuit and ate it,
without looking up from his reading.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d answer questions,&rdquo;
Challis remarked to Lewes, later.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should prescribe a sound shaking,&rdquo;
returned Lewes.</p>
<p class="par">Challis smiled. &ldquo;Well, see here, Lewes,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the responsibility; you go and experiment,
go and shake him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lewes looked through the folding doors at the picture of
the Wonder, intent on his study of the great dictionary. &ldquo;Since
you&rsquo;ve franked me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
it&mdash;but not now. I&rsquo;ll wait till he gives me some
occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; replied Challis, &ldquo;my offer
holds ... and, by the way, I have no doubt that an occasion will
present itself. Doesn&rsquo;t it strike you as likely, Lewes, that we
shall see a good deal of the child here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They stood for some minutes, watching the picture
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>of that intent student, framed in the written
thoughts of his predecessors.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Wonder ignored an invitation to lunch; he
ignored, also, the tray that was sent in to him. He read on steadily
till a quarter to six, by which time he was at the end of
&ldquo;L,&rdquo; and then he climbed down from his Encyclop&aelig;dia,
and made for the door. Challis, working in the farther room, saw him
and came out to open the door.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you going now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">The child nodded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will order the cart for you, if you will wait
ten minutes,&rdquo; said Challis.</p>
<p class="par">The child shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very
necessary to have air,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">Something in the tone and pronunciation struck Challis,
and awoke a long dormant memory. The sentence spoken, suddenly conjured
up a vision of the Stotts&rsquo; cottage at Stoke, of the Stotts at
tea, of a cradle in the shadow, and of himself, sitting in an
uncomfortable armchair and swinging his stick between his knees. When
the child had gone&mdash;walking deliberately, and evidently regarding
the mile-and-a-half walk through the twilight wood and over the
deserted Common as a trivial incident in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>the day&rsquo;s
business&mdash;Challis set himself to analyse that curious
association.</p>
<p class="par">As he strolled back across the hall to the library, he
tried to reconstruct the scene of the cottage at Stoke, and to recall
the outline of the conversation he had had with the Stotts.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Lewes!&rdquo; he said, when he reached the room
in which his secretary was working, &ldquo;Lewes, this is
curious,&rdquo; and he described the associations called up by the
child&rsquo;s speech. &ldquo;The curious thing is,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;that I had gone to advise Mrs. Stott to take a cottage at Pym,
because the Stoke villagers were hostile, in some way, and she did not
care to take the child out in the street. It is more than probable that
I used just those words, &lsquo;It is very necessary to have
air,&rsquo; very probable. Now, what about my memory theory? The child
was only six months old at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lewes appeared unconvinced. &ldquo;There is nothing very
unusual in the sentence,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; replied Challis, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t agree with you. It is not phrased as a villager would
phrase it, and, as I tell you, it was not spoken with the local
accent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You may have spoken the sentence to-day,&rdquo;
suggested Lewes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I may, of course, though I don&rsquo;t remember
saying anything of the sort, but that would not account for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>the curiously vivid association which was
conjured up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lewes pursed his lips. &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;But that is hardly ground for argument, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; returned Challis
thoughtfully; &ldquo;but when you take up psychology, Lewes, I should
much like you to specialise in a careful inquiry into association in
connection with memory. I feel certain that if one can reproduce, as
nearly as may be, any complex sensation one has experienced, no matter
how long ago, one will stimulate what I may call an abnormal memory of
all the associations connected with that experience. Just now I saw the
interior of that room in the Stotts&rsquo; cottage so clearly that I
had an image of a dreadful oleograph of Disraeli hanging on the wall.
But, now, I cannot for the life of me remember whether there was such
an oleograph or not. I do not remember noticing it at the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s very interesting,&rdquo;
replied Lewes. &ldquo;There is certainly a wide field for research in
that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You might throw much light on our mental
processes,&rdquo; replied Challis.</p>
<p class="par">(It was as the outcome of this conversation that Gregory
Lewes did, two years afterwards, take up this line of study. The only
result up to the present time is his little brochure <i>Reflexive
Associations</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161"

<p class="par first">Challis&rsquo;s anticipation that he and Lewes
would be greatly favoured by the Wonder&rsquo;s company was fully
realised.</p>
<p class="par">The child put in an appearance at half-past nine the
next morning, just as the governess cart was starting out to fetch him.
When he was admitted he went straight to the library, climbed on to the
chair, upon which the volumes of the Encyclop&aelig;dia still remained,
and continued his reading where he had left off on the previous
evening.</p>
<p class="par">He read steadily throughout the day without giving
utterance to speech of any kind.</p>
<p class="par">Challis and Lewes went out in the afternoon, and left
the child deep in study. They came in at five o&rsquo;clock, and went
to the library. The Wonder, however, was not there.</p>
<p class="par">Challis rang the bell.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Has little Stott gone?&rdquo; he asked when
Heathcote came.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t seen &rsquo;im, sir,&rdquo;
said Heathcote.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Just find out if any one opened the door for him,
will you?&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t possibly have
opened that door for himself.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite sure, sir. I&rsquo;ve made full
hinquiries,&rdquo; said Heathcote with dignity.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better find him,&rdquo; said
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The window is open,&rdquo; suggested Lewes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He would hardly ...&rdquo; began Challis, walking
over to the low sill of the open window, but he broke off in his
sentence and continued, &ldquo;By Jove, he did, though; look
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was, indeed, quite obvious that the Wonder had made
his exit by the window; the tiny prints of his feet were clearly marked
in the mould of the flowerbed; he had, moreover, disregarded all
results of early spring floriculture.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;See how he has smashed those daffodils,&rdquo;
said Lewes. &ldquo;What an infernally cheeky little brute he
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What interests me is the logic of the
child,&rdquo; returned Challis. &ldquo;I would venture to guess that he
wasted no time in trying to attract attention. The door was closed, so
he just got out of the window. I rather admire the spirit; there is
something Napoleonic about him. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lewes shrugged his shoulders. Heathcote&rsquo;s
expression was quite non-committal.</p>

<p class="par first">&ldquo;What can I give that child to read
to-day?&rdquo; asked Challis at breakfast next morning.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should reverse the arrangement; let him sit on
the Dictionary and read the Encyclop&aelig;dia.&rdquo; Lewes always
approached the subject of the Wonder with a certain supercilious
contempt.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are not convinced yet that he isn&rsquo;t
humbugging?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No! Frankly, I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, well, we must wait for more evidence,
before we argue about it,&rdquo; said Challis, but they sat on over the
breakfast-table, waiting for the child to put in an appearance, and
their conversation hovered over the topic of his intelligence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Half-past ten?&rdquo; Challis ejaculated at last,
with surprise. &ldquo;We are getting into slack habits, Lewes.&rdquo;
He rose and rang the bell.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Apparently the Stott infant has had enough of
it,&rdquo; suggested Lewes. &ldquo;Perhaps he has exhausted the
interest of dictionary illustrations.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; replied Challis, and then to
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>deferentially appearing Heathcote he said:
&ldquo;Has Master Stott come this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir. Leastways, no one &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t let
&rsquo;im in, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It may be that he is mentally collating the
results of the past two days&rsquo; reading,&rdquo; said Challis, as he
and Lewes made their way to the library.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; was all Lewes&rsquo;s reply, but it
conveyed much of impatient contempt for his employer&rsquo;s
attitude.</p>
<p class="par">Challis only smiled.</p>
<p class="par">When they entered the library they found the Wonder hard
at work, and he had, of his own initiative, adopted the plan ironically
suggested by Lewes, for he had succeeded in transferring the Dictionary
volumes to the chair, and he was deep in volume one, of the eleventh
edition of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>.</p>
<p class="par">The library was never cleared up by any one except
Challis or his deputy, but an early housemaid had been sent to dust,
and she had left the casement of one of the lower lights of the window
open. The means of the Wonder&rsquo;s entrance was thus clearly in
evidence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Napoleonic,&rdquo; murmured
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most infernal cheek,&rdquo; returned
Lewes in a loud voice, &ldquo;I should not be at all surprised if that
promised shaking were not administered to-day.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Wonder took no notice. Challis says that on that
morning his eyes were travelling down the page at about the rate at
which one could count the lines.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t reading,&rdquo; said Lewes.
&ldquo;No one could read as fast as that, and most certainly not a
child of four and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If he would only answer questions....&rdquo;
hesitated Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! of course he won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said
Lewes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s clever enough not to give himself
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The two men went over to the table and looked down over
the child&rsquo;s shoulder. He was in the middle of the article on
algebra.</p>
<p class="par">Lewes made a gesture. &ldquo;Now do you believe
he&rsquo;s humbugging?&rdquo; he asked confidently, and made no effort
to modulate his voice.</p>
<p class="par">Challis drew his eyebrows together. &ldquo;My
boy,&rdquo; he said, and laid his hand lightly on Victor Stott&rsquo;s
shoulder, &ldquo;can you understand what you are reading
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But no answer was vouchsafed. Challis sighed.
&ldquo;Come along, Lewes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we must waste no more
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lewes wore a look of smug triumph as they went to the
farther room, but he was clever enough to refrain from expressing his
triumph in speech. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Challis gave directions that the window which the
Wonder had found to be his most convenient method of entry and exit
should be kept open, except at night; and a stool was placed under the
sill inside the room, and a low bench was fixed outside to facilitate
the child&rsquo;s goings and comings. Also, a little path was made
across the flowerbed.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder gave no trouble. He arrived at nine
o&rsquo;clock every morning, Sunday included, and left at a quarter to
six in the evening. On wet days he was provided with a waterproof which
had evidently been made by his mother out of a larger garment. This he
took off when he entered the room and left on the stool under the
window.</p>
<p class="par">He was given a glass of milk and a plate of
bread-and-butter at twelve o&rsquo;clock; and except for this he
demanded and received no attention.</p>
<p class="par">For three weeks he devoted himself exclusively to the
study of the Encyclop&aelig;dia.</p>
<p class="par">Lewes was puzzled.</p>
<p class="par">Challis spoke little of the child during these three
weeks, but he often stood at the entrance to the farther rooms and
watched the Wonder&rsquo;s eyes travelling so rapidly yet so intently
down the page. That sight had a curious fascination for him; he
returned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>to his own work by an effort, and an hour
afterwards he would be back again at the door of the larger room.
Sometimes Lewes would hear him mutter: &ldquo;If he would only answer a
few questions....&rdquo; There was always one hope in Challis&rsquo;s
mind. He hoped that some sort of climax might be reached when the
Encyclop&aelig;dia was finished. The child must, at least, ask then for
another book. Even if he chose one for himself, his choice might
furnish some sort of a test.</p>
<p class="par">So Challis waited and said little; and Lewes was
puzzled, because he was beginning to doubt whether it were possible
that the child could sustain a pose so long. That, in itself, would be
evidence of extraordinary abnormality. Lewes fumbled in his mind for
another hypothesis.</p>
<p class="par">This reading craze may be symptomatic of some form of
idiocy, was his thought; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t believe he does
read,&rdquo; was the inevitable rider.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Stott usually came to meet her son, and sometimes
she would come early in the afternoon and stand at the window watching
him at his work; but neither Challis nor Lewes ever saw the Wonder
display by any sign that he was aware of his mother&rsquo;s
presence.</p>
<p class="par">During those three weeks the Wonder held himself
completely detached from any intercourse with the world of men. At the
end of that period he once <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href=
"#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>more manifested his awareness of
the human factor in existence.</p>
<p class="par">Challis, if he spoke little to Lewes of the Wonder
during this time, maintained a strict observation of the child&rsquo;s
doings.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder began his last volume of the
Encyclop&aelig;dia one Wednesday afternoon soon after lunch, and on
Thursday morning, Challis was continually in and out of the room
watching the child&rsquo;s progress, and noting his nearness to the end
of the colossal task he had undertaken.</p>
<p class="par">At a quarter to twelve he took up his old position in
the doorway, and with his hands clasped behind his back he watched the
reading of the last forty pages.</p>
<p class="par">There was no slackening and no quickening in the
Wonder&rsquo;s rate of progress. He read the articles under
&ldquo;Z&rdquo; with the same attention he had given to the remainder
of the work, and then, arrived at the last page, he closed the volume
and took up the Index.</p>
<p class="par">Challis suffered a qualm; not so much on account of the
possible postponement of the crisis he was awaiting, as because he saw
that the reading of the Index could only be taken as a sign that the
whole study had been unintelligent. No one could conceivably have any
purpose in reading through an index. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">And at this moment Lewes joined him in the doorway.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What volume has he got to now?&rdquo; asked
Lewes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Index,&rdquo; returned Challis.</p>
<p class="par">Lewes was no less quick in drawing his inference than
Challis had been.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, that settles it, I should think,&rdquo; was
Lewes&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wait, wait,&rdquo; returned Challis.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder turned a dozen pages at once, glanced at the
new opening, made a further brief examination of two or three headings
near the end of the volume, closed the book, and looked up.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you finished?&rdquo; asked Challis.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder shook his head. &ldquo;All this,&rdquo; he
said&mdash;he indicated with a small and dirty hand the pile of volumes
that were massed round him&mdash;&ldquo;all this ...&rdquo; he
repeated, hesitated for a word, and again shook his head with that
solemn, deliberate impressiveness which marked all his actions.</p>
<p class="par">Challis came towards the child, leaned over the table
for a moment, and then sat down opposite to him. Between the two
protagonists hovered Lewes, sceptical, inclined towards aggression.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am most interested,&rdquo; said Challis.
&ldquo;Will you try to tell me, my boy, what you think of&mdash;all
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So elementary ... inchoate ... a <span class=
"corr" id="xd22e2940" title="Source: disjuncttive">disjunctive</span>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>... patchwork&rdquo; replied the Wonder. His
abstracted eyes were blind to the objective world of our reality; he
seemed to be profoundly analysing the very elements of thought.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Then that almost voiceless child found words.
Heathcote&rsquo;s announcement of lunch was waved aside, the long
afternoon waned, and still that thin trickle of sound flowed on.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder spoke in odd, pedantic phrases; he used the
technicalities of every science; he constructed his sentences in
unusual ways, and often he paused for a word and gave up the search,
admitting that his meaning could not be expressed through the medium of
any language known to him.</p>
<p class="par">Occasionally Challis would interrupt him fiercely, would
even rise from his chair and pace the room, arguing, stating a point of
view, combating some suggestion that underlay the trend of that
pitiless wisdom which in the end bore him down with its unanswerable
insistence.</p>
<p class="par">During those long hours much was stated by that small,
thin voice which was utterly beyond the comprehension of the two
listeners; indeed, it is doubtful whether even Challis understood a
tithe of the theory that was actually expressed in words. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">As for Lewes, though he was at the time non-plussed,
quelled, he was in the outcome impressed rather by the marvellous
powers of memory exhibited than by the far finer powers shown in the
superhuman logic of the synthesis.</p>
<p class="par">One sees that Lewes entered upon the interview with a
mind predisposed to criticise, to destroy. There can be no doubt that
as he listened his uninformed mind was endeavouring to analyse, to
weigh, and to oppose; and this antagonism and his own thoughts
continually interposed between him and the thought of the speaker.
Lewes&rsquo;s account of what was spoken on that afternoon is utterly
worthless.</p>
<p class="par">Challis&rsquo;s failure to comprehend was not, at the
outset, due to his antagonistic attitude. He began with an earnest wish
to understand: he failed only because the thing spoken was beyond the
scope of his intellectual powers. But he did, nevertheless, understand
the trend of that analysis of progress; he did in some half-realised
way apprehend the gist of that terrible deduction of a final
adjustment.</p>
<p class="par">He must have apprehended, in part, for he fiercely
combated the argument, only to quaver, at last, into a silence which
permitted again that trickle of hesitating, pedantic speech, which was
yet so overwhelming, so conclusive.</p>
<p class="par">As the afternoon wore on, however, Challis&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>attitude must have changed; he must have assumed
an armour of mental resistance not unlike the resistance of Lewes.
Challis perceived, however dimly, that life would hold no further
pleasure for him if he accepted that theory of origin, evolution, and
final adjustment; he found in this cosmogony no place for his own
idealism; and he feared to be convinced even by that fraction of the
whole argument which he could understand.</p>
<p class="par">We see that Challis, with all his apparent devotion to
science, was never more than a dilettante. He had another stake in the
world which, at the last analysis, he valued more highly than the
acquisition of knowledge. Those means of ease, of comfort, of liberty,
of opportunity to choose his work among various interests, were the
ruling influence of his life. With it all Challis was an idealist, and
unpractical. His genial charity, his refinement of mind, his unthinking
generosity, indicate the bias of a character which inclined always
towards a picturesque optimism. It is not difficult to understand that
he dared not allow himself to be convinced by Victor Stott&rsquo;s
appalling synthesis.</p>
<p class="par">At last, when the twilight was deepening into night, the
voice ceased, the child&rsquo;s story had been told, and it had not
been understood. The Wonder never again spoke of his theory of life. He
realised from that time that no one could comprehend him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">As he rose to go, he asked one question that, simple as
was its expression, had a deep and wonderful significance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is there none of my kind?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Is this,&rdquo; and he laid a hand on the pile of books before
him, &ldquo;is this all?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is none of your kind,&rdquo; replied
Challis; and the little figure born into a world that could not
understand him, that was not ready to receive him, walked to the window
and climbed out into the darkness.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">(Henry Challis is the only man who could ever have given
any account of that extraordinary analysis of life, and he made no
effort to recall the fundamental basis of the argument, and so allowed
his memory of the essential part to fade. Moreover, he had a marked
disinclination to speak of that afternoon or of anything that was said
by Victor Stott during those six momentous hours of expression. It is
evident that Challis&rsquo;s attitude to Victor Stott was not unlike
the attitude of Captain Wallis to Victor Stott&rsquo;s father on the
occasion of Hampdenshire&rsquo;s historic match with Surrey.
&ldquo;This man will have to be barred,&rdquo; Wallis said. &ldquo;It
means the end of cricket.&rdquo; Challis, in effect, thought that if
Victor Stott were encouraged, it would mean the end of research,
philosophy, all the mystery, idealism, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb174" href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>and joy of life.
Once, and once only, did Challis give me any idea of what he had
learned during that afternoon&rsquo;s colloquy, and the substance of
what Challis then told me will be found at the end of this volume.)

<p class="par first">For many months after that long afternoon in the
library, Challis was affected with a fever of restlessness, and his
work on the book stood still. He was in Rome during May, and in June he
was seized by a sudden whim and went to China by the Trans-Siberian
railway. Lewes did not accompany him. Challis preferred, one imagines,
to have no intercourse with Lewes while the memory of certain
pronouncements was still fresh. He might have been tempted to discuss
that interview, and if, as was practically certain, Lewes attempted to
pour contempt on the whole affair, Challis might have been drawn into a
defence which would have revived many memories he wished to
obliterate.</p>
<p class="par">He came back to London in September&mdash;he made the
return journey by steamer&mdash;and found his secretary still working
at the monograph on the primitive peoples of Melanesia. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Lewes had spent the whole summer in Challis&rsquo;s town
house in Eaton Square, whither all the material had been removed two
days after that momentous afternoon in the library of Challis
Court.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have been wanting your help badly for some
time, sir,&rdquo; Lewes said on the evening of Challis&rsquo;s return.
&ldquo;Are you proposing to take up the work again? If not....&rdquo;
Gregory Lewes thought he was wasting valuable time.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course; I am ready to begin again
now, if you care to go on with me,&rdquo; said Challis. He talked for a
few minutes of the book without any great show of interest. Presently
they came to a pause, and Lewes suggested that he should give some
account of how his time had been spent.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; replied Challis,
&ldquo;to-morrow will be time enough. I shall settle down again in a
few days.&rdquo; He hesitated a moment, and then said: &ldquo;Any news
from Chilborough?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;N-no, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; returned
Lewes. He was occupied with his own interests; he doubted
Challis&rsquo;s intention to continue his work on the book&mdash;the
announcement had been so half-hearted.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What about that child?&rdquo; asked Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That child?&rdquo; Lewes appeared to have
forgotten the existence of Victor Stott.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That abnormal child of Stott&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
prompted Challis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177"
name="pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! Of course, yes. I believe he still goes
nearly every day to the library. I have been down there two or three
times, and found him reading. He has learned the use of the
index-catalogue. He can get any book he wants. He uses the
steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know what he reads?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t say I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you think will become of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! these infant prodigies, you know,&rdquo; said
Lewes with a large air of authority, &ldquo;they all go the same way.
Most of them die young, of course, the others develop into ordinary
commonplace men rather under than over the normal ability. After all,
it is what one would expect. Nature always maintains her average by
some means or another. If a child like this with his abnormal memory
were to go on developing, there would be no place for him in the
world&rsquo;s economy. The idea is inconceivable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; murmured Challis, and after
a short silence he added: &ldquo;You think he will deteriorate, that
his faculties will decay prematurely?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should say there could be no doubt of
it,&rdquo; replied Lewes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! well. I&rsquo;ll go down and have a look at
him, one day next week,&rdquo; said Challis; but he did not go till the
middle of October.</p>
<p class="par">The direct cause of his going was a letter from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>Crashaw, who offered to come up to town, as the
matter was one of &ldquo;really peculiar urgency.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wonder if young Stott has been blaspheming
again,&rdquo; Challis remarked to Lewes. &ldquo;Wire the man that
I&rsquo;ll go down and see him this afternoon. I shall motor. Say
I&rsquo;ll be at Stoke about half-past three.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par first">Challis was ushered into Crashaw&rsquo;s study on
his arrival, and found the rector in company with another
man&mdash;introduced as Mr. Forman&mdash;a jolly-looking,
high-complexioned man of sixty or so, with a great quantity of white
hair on his head and face; he was wearing an old-fashioned morning-coat
and grey trousers that were noticeably too short for him.</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw lost no time in introducing the subject of
&ldquo;really peculiar urgency,&rdquo; but he rambled in his
introduction.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have probably forgotten,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that last spring I had to bring a most horrible charge against a
child called Victor Stott, who has since been living, practically, as I
may say, under your &aelig;gis, that is, he has, at least, spent a
greater part of his day, er&mdash;playing in your library at Challis
Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite, quite; I remember perfectly,&rdquo; said
Challis. &ldquo;I made myself responsible for him up to a certain
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>point. I gave him an occupation. It was
intended, was it not, to divert his mind from speaking against religion
to the yokels?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite a character, if I may say so,&rdquo; put in
Mr. Forman cheerfully.</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw was seated at his study table; the affair had
something the effect of an examining magistrate taking the evidence of
witnesses.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said testily; &ldquo;I did
ask your help, Mr. Challis, and I did, in a way, receive some
assistance from you. That is, the child has to some extent been
isolated by spending so much of his time at your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Has he broken out again?&rdquo; asked
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I understand you to mean has the child been
speaking openly on any subject connected with religion, I must say
&lsquo;No,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Crashaw. &ldquo;But he never attends any
Sunday school, or place of worship; he has received no instruction
in&mdash;er&mdash;any sacred subject, though I understand he is able to
read; and his time is spent among books which, pardon me, would not, I
suppose, be likely to give a serious turn to his thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Serious?&rdquo; questioned Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perhaps I should say
&lsquo;religious,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Crashaw. &ldquo;To me the two
words are synonymous.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Forman bowed his head slightly with an air of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>reverence, and nodded two or three times to
express his perfect approval of the rector&rsquo;s sentiments.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You think the child&rsquo;s mind is being
perverted by his intercourse with the books in the library where
he&mdash;he&mdash;&lsquo;plays&rsquo; was your word, I
believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, not altogether,&rdquo; replied Crashaw,
drawing his eyebrows together. &ldquo;We can hardly suppose that he is
able at so tender an age to read, much less to understand, those works
of philosophy and science which would produce an evil effect on his
mind. I am willing to admit, since I, too, have had some training in
scientific reading, that writers on those subjects are not easily
understood even by the mature intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then why, exactly, do you wish me to prohibit the
child from coming to Challis Court?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Possibly you have not realised that the child is
now five years old?&rdquo; said Crashaw with an air of conferring
illumination.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Indeed! Yes. An age of some discretion, no
doubt,&rdquo; returned Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;An age at which the State requires that he should
receive the elements of education,&rdquo; continued Crashaw.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Time he went to school,&rdquo; explained Mr.
Forman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been after him, you know. I&rsquo;m the
attendance officer for this district.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Challis for once committed a breach of good manners. The
import of the thing suddenly appealed to his sense of humour: he began
to chuckle and then he laughed out a great, hearty laugh, such as had
not been stirred in him for twenty years.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! forgive me, forgive me,&rdquo; he said, when
he had recovered his self-control. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know; you
can&rsquo;t conceive the utter, childish absurdity of setting that
child to recite the multiplication table with village infants of his
own age. Oh! believe me, if you could only guess, you would laugh with
me. It&rsquo;s so funny, so inimitably funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I fail to see, Mr. Challis,&rdquo; said Crashaw,
&ldquo;that there is anything in any way absurd or&mdash;or unusual in
the preposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Five is the age fixed by the State,&rdquo; said
Mr. Forman. He had relaxed into a broad smile in sympathy with
Challis&rsquo;s laugh, but he had now relapsed into a fair imitation of
Crashaw&rsquo;s intense seriousness.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! How can I explain?&rdquo; said Challis.
&ldquo;Let me take an instance. You propose to teach him, among other
things, the elements of arithmetic?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is a part of the curriculum,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Forman.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have only had one conversation with this
child,&rdquo; went on Challis&mdash;and at the mention of that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>conversation his brows drew together and he
became very grave again; &ldquo;but in the course of that conversation
this child had occasion to refer, by way of illustration, to some
abstruse theorem of the differential calculus. He did it, you will
understand, by way of making his meaning clear&mdash;though the
illustration was utterly beyond me: that reference represented an act
of intellectual condescension.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;God bless me, you don&rsquo;t say so?&rdquo; said
Mr. Forman.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I cannot see,&rdquo; said Crashaw, &ldquo;that
this instance of yours, Mr. Challis, has any real bearing on the
situation. If the child is a mathematical genius&mdash;there have been
instances in history, such as Blaise Pascal&mdash;he would not, of
course, receive elementary instruction in a subject with which he was
already acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You could not find any subject, believe me,
Crashaw, in which he could be instructed by any teacher in a Council
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Forgive me, I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo;
returned Crashaw. &ldquo;He is sadly in need of some religious
training.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He would not get that at a Council school,&rdquo;
said Challis, and Mr. Forman shook his head sadly, as though he greatly
deprecated the fact.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He must learn to recognise authority,&rdquo; said
Crashaw. &ldquo;When he has been taught the necessity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>of
submitting himself to all his governors, teachers, spiritual pastors,
and masters: ordering himself lowly and reverently to all his betters;
when, I say, he has learnt that lesson, he may be in a fit and proper
condition to receive the teachings of the Holy Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Forman appeared to think he was attending divine
service. If the rector had said &ldquo;Let us pray,&rdquo; there can be
no doubt that he would immediately have fallen on his knees.</p>
<p class="par">Challis shook his head. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
understand, Crashaw,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I <i>do</i> understand,&rdquo; said Crashaw,
rising to his feet, &ldquo;and I intend to see that the statute is not
disobeyed in the case of this child, Victor Stott.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis shrugged his shoulders; Mr. Forman assumed an
expression of stern determination.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In any case, why drag me into it?&rdquo; asked
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw sat down again. The flush which had warmed his
sallow skin subsided as his passion died out. He had worked himself
into a condition of righteous indignation, but the calm politeness of
Challis rebuked him. If Crashaw prided himself on his devotion to the
Church, he did not wish that attitude to overshadow the pride he also
took in the belief that he was Challis&rsquo;s social equal.
Crashaw&rsquo;s father had been a lawyer, with a fair practice in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>Derby, but he had worked his way up to a
partnership from the position of office-boy, and Percy Crashaw seldom
forgot to be conscious that he was a gentleman by education and
profession.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I did not wish to <i>drag</i> you into this
business,&rdquo; he said quietly, putting his elbows on the
writing-table in front of him, and reassuming the judicial attitude he
had adopted earlier; &ldquo;but I regard this child as, in some sense,
your prot&eacute;g&eacute;.&rdquo; Crashaw put the tips of his fingers
together, and Mr. Forman watched him warily, waiting for his cue. If
this was to be a case for prayer, Mr. Forman was ready, with a clean
white handkerchief to kneel upon.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In some sense, perhaps,&rdquo; returned Challis.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him for some months.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cannot you see the necessity of his attending
school?&rdquo; asked Crashaw, this time with an insinuating suavity; he
believed that Challis was coming round.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Challis sighed with a note of
expostulation. &ldquo;Oh! the thing&rsquo;s grotesque,
ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; put in Mr. Forman, who
had been struck by a brilliant idea, &ldquo;why not bring the child
here, and let the Reverend Mr. Crashaw, or myself, put a few general
questions to &rsquo;im?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; hesitated Crashaw, &ldquo;that
might be done; but, of course, the decision does not rest with
us.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It rests with the Local Authority,&rdquo; mused
Challis. He was running over three or four names of members of that
body who were known to him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Crashaw, &ldquo;the Local
Education Authority alone has the right to prosecute,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He did not state his antithesis. They had come
to the crux which Crashaw had wished to avoid. He had no weight with
the committee of the L.E.A., and Challis&rsquo;s recommendation would
have much weight. Crashaw intended that Victor Stott should attend
school, but he had bungled his preliminaries: he had rested on his own
authority, and forgotten that Challis had little respect for that
influence. Conciliation was the only card to play now.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I brought him, he wouldn&rsquo;t answer your
questions,&rdquo; sighed Challis. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very difficult to
deal with.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is he, indeed?&rdquo; sympathised Mr. Forman.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ardly seen &rsquo;im myself; not to speak to,
that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He might come with his mother,&rdquo; suggested
Crashaw.</p>
<p class="par">Challis shook his head. &ldquo;By the way, it is the
mother whom you would proceed against?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The parent is responsible,&rdquo; said Mr.
Forman. &ldquo;She will be brought before a magistrate and fined for
the first offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t fine her if she comes before
me,&rdquo; replied Challis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href=
"#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Crashaw smiled. He meant to avoid that eventuality.</p>
<p class="par">The little meeting lapsed into a brief silence. There
seemed to be nothing more to say.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Crashaw, at last, with a rising
inflexion that had a conciliatory, encouraging, now-my-little-man kind
of air, &ldquo;We-ll, of course, no one wishes to proceed to extremes.
I think, Mr. Challis, I think I may say that you are the person who has
most influence in this matter, and I cannot believe that you will go
against the established authority both of the Church and the State. If
it were only for the sake of example.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis rose deliberately. He shook his head, and
unconsciously his hands went behind his back. There was hardly room for
him to pace up and down, but he took two steps towards Mr. Forman, who
immediately rose to his feet; and then he turned and went over to the
window. It was from there that he pronounced his ultimatum.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Regulations, laws, religious and lay
authorities,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come into existence in order to
deal with the rule, the average. That must be so. But if we are a
reasoning, intellectual people we must have some means of dealing with
the exception. That means rests with a consensus of intelligent opinion
strong enough to set the rule upon one side. In an overwhelming
majority of cases there <i>is</i> no such consensus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>of
opinion, and the exceptional individual suffers by coming within the
rule of a law which should not apply to him. Now, I put it to you, as
reasoning, intelligent men&rdquo; (&rsquo;ear, &rsquo;ear, murmured Mr.
Forman automatically), &ldquo;are we, now that we have the power to
perform a common act of justice, to exempt an unfortunate individual
exception who has come within the rule of a law that holds no
application for him, or are we to exhibit a crass stupidity by
enforcing that law? Is it not better to take the case into our own
hands, and act according to the dictates of common sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very forcibly put,&rdquo; murmured Mr.
Forman.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not finding any fault with the law or
the principle of the law,&rdquo; continued Challis; &ldquo;but it is,
it must be, framed for the average. We must use our discretion in
dealing with the exception&mdash;and this is an exception such as has
never occurred since we have had an Education Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; said
Crashaw, stubbornly. &ldquo;I do not consider this an
exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you <i>must</i> agree with me, Crashaw. I
have a certain amount of influence and I shall use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; replied Crashaw, rising to
his feet, &ldquo;I shall fight you to the bitter end. I am
<i>determined</i>&rdquo;&mdash;he raised his voice and struck the
writing-table with his fist&mdash;&ldquo;I am <i>determined</i> that
this infidel child shall go to school. I am prepared, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>if
necessary, to spend all my leisure in seeing that the law is carried
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Forman had also risen. &ldquo;Very right, very
right, indeed,&rdquo; he said, and he knitted his mild brows and
stroked his patriarchal white beard with a simulation of stern
determination.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think you would be better advised to let the
matter rest,&rdquo; said Challis.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Forman looked inquiringly at the representative of
the Church.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall fight,&rdquo; replied Crashaw,
stubbornly, fiercely.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Mr. Forman.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very well, as you think best,&rdquo; was
Challis&rsquo;s last word.</p>
<p class="par">As Challis walked down to the gate, where his motor was
awaiting him, Mr. Forman trotted up from behind and ranged himself
alongside.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;More rain wanted yet for the roots, sir,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;September was a grand month for &rsquo;arvest, but we
want rain badly now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; murmured Challis, politely.
He shook hands with Mr. Forman before he got into the car.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Forman, standing politely bareheaded, saw that Mr.
Challis&rsquo;s car went in the direction of Ailesworth. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Challis&rsquo;s first visit was paid to Sir Deane
Elmer, that man of many activities, whose name inevitably suggests his
favourite phrase of &ldquo;Organised Progress&rdquo;&mdash;with all its
variants.</p>
<p class="par">This is hardly the place in which to criticise a man of
such diverse abilities as Deane Elmer, a man whose name still figures
so prominently in the public press in connection with all that is most
modern in eugenics; with the Social Reform programme of the moderate
party; with the reconstruction of our penal system; with education, and
so many kindred interests; and, finally, of course, with colour
photography and process printing. This last Deane Elmer always spoke of
as his hobby, but we may doubt whether all his interests were not
hobbies in the same sense. He is the natural descendant of those
earlier amateur scientists&mdash;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>adjective conveys no
reproach&mdash;of the nineteenth century, among whom we remember such
striking figures as those of Lord Avebury and Sir Francis Galton.</p>
<p class="par">In appearance Deane Elmer was a big, heavy, rather
corpulent man, with a high complexion, and his clean-shaven jowl and
his succession of chins hung in heavy folds. But any suggestion of
material grossness was contradicted by the brightness of his rather
pale-blue eyes, by his alertness of manner, and by his ready, whimsical
humour.</p>
<p class="par">As chairman of the Ailesworth County Council, and its
most prominent unpaid public official&mdash;after the mayor&mdash;Sir
Deane Elmer was certainly the most important member of the Local
Authority, and Challis wisely sought him at once. He found him in the
garden of his comparatively small establishment on the Quainton side of
the town. Elmer was very much engaged in photographing flowers from
nature through the ruled screen and colour filter&mdash;in
experimenting with the Elmer process, in fact; by which the
intermediate stage of a coloured negative is rendered unnecessary. His
apparatus was complicated and cumbrous.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Show Mr. Challis out here,&rdquo; he commanded
the man who brought the announcement.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You must forgive me, Challis,&rdquo; said Elmer,
when Challis appeared. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had such a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>still day for weeks. It&rsquo;s the wind upsets
us in this process. Screens create a partial vacuum.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He was launched on a lecture upon his darling process
before Challis could get in a word. It was best to let him have his
head, and Challis took an intelligent interest.</p>
<p class="par">It was not until the photographs were taken, and his two
assistants could safely be trusted to complete the mechanical
operations, that Elmer could be divorced from his hobby. He was full of
jubilation. &ldquo;We should have excellent results,&rdquo; he
boomed&mdash;he had a tremendous voice&mdash;&ldquo;but we shan&rsquo;t
be able to judge until we get the blocks made. We do it all on the
spot. I have a couple of platens in the shops here; but we shan&rsquo;t
be able to take a pull until to-morrow morning, I&rsquo;m afraid. You
shall have a proof, Challis. We <i>should</i> get magnificent
results.&rdquo; He looked benignantly at the vault of heaven, which had
been so obligingly free from any current of air.</p>
<p class="par">Challis was beginning to fear that even now he would be
allowed no opportunity to open the subject of his mission. But quite
suddenly Elmer dropped the shutter on his preoccupation, and with that
ready adaptability which was so characteristic of the man, forgot his
hobby for the time being, and turned his whole attention to a new
subject.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is the latest
news in anthropology?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href=
"#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A very remarkable phenomenon,&rdquo; replied
Challis. &ldquo;That is what I have come to see you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I thought you were in Paraguay pigging it with
the Guaranis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, no; I don&rsquo;t touch the Americas,&rdquo;
interposed Challis. &ldquo;I want all your attention, Elmer. This is
important.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come into my study,&rdquo; said Elmer, &ldquo;and
let us have the facts. What will you have&mdash;tea, whisky,
beer?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis&rsquo;s r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the facts need
not be reported. When it was accomplished, Elmer put several keen
questions, and finally delivered his verdict thus:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We must see the boy, Challis. Personally I am, of
course, satisfied, but we must not give Crashaw opportunity to raise
endless questions, as he can and will. There is Mayor Purvis, the
grocer, to be reckoned with, you must remember. He represents a
powerful Nonconformist influence. Crashaw will get hold of
him&mdash;and work him if we see Purvis first. Purvis always stiffens
his neck against any breach of conventional procedure. If Crashaw saw
him first, well and good, Purvis would immediately jump to the
conclusion that Crashaw intended some subtle attack on the
Nonconformist position, and would side with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I know Purvis,&rdquo; mused
Challis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Purvis &amp; Co. in the Square,&rdquo; prompted
Elmer. &ldquo;Black-and-white fellow; black moustache and side
whiskers, black eyes and white face. There&rsquo;s a suggestion of the
Methodist pulpit about him. Doesn&rsquo;t appear in the shop much, and
when he does, always looks as if he&rsquo;d sooner sell you a Bible
than a bottle of whisky.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, yes! I know,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;I
daresay you&rsquo;re right, Elmer; but it will be difficult to persuade
this child to answer any questions his examiners may put to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Surely he must be open to reason,&rdquo; roared
Elmer. &ldquo;You tell me he has an extraordinary intelligence, and in
the next sentence you imply that the child&rsquo;s a fool who
can&rsquo;t open his mouth to serve his own interests. What&rsquo;s
your paradox?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sublimated material. Intellectual insight and
absolute spiritual blindness,&rdquo; replied Challis, getting to his
feet. &ldquo;The child has gone too far in one direction&mdash;in
another he has made not one step. His mind is a magnificent, terrible
machine. He has the imagination of a mathematician and a logician
developed beyond all conception, he has not one spark of the
imagination of a poet. And so he cannot deal with men; he can&rsquo;t
understand their weaknesses and limitations; they are geese and hens to
him, creatures to be scared out of his vicinity. However, I will see
what I can do. Could you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>arrange for the members of the
Authority to come to my place?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should think so. Yes,&rdquo; said Elmer.
&ldquo;I say, Challis, are you sure you&rsquo;re right about this
child? Sounds to me like some&mdash;some freak.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; returned Challis.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and arrange an interview. I&rsquo;ll let you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And, by the way,&rdquo; said Elmer, &ldquo;you
had better invite Crashaw to be present. He will put Purvis&rsquo;s
back up, and that&rsquo;ll enlist the difficult grocer on our side
probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When Challis had gone, Elmer stood for a few minutes,
thoughtfully scratching the ample red surface of his wide, clean-shaven
cheek. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he ejaculated at last,
addressing his empty study, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; And with
that expression he put all thought of Victor Stott away from him, and
sat down to write an exhaustive article on the necessity for a broader
basis in primary education.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Challis called at the rectory of Stoke-Underhill
on his way back to his own house.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I give way,&rdquo; was the characteristic of his
attitude to Crashaw, and the rector suppled his back again, remembered
the Derby office-boy&rsquo;s tendency to brag, and made the amende
honorable. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>even overdid his magnanimity and came too near
subservience&mdash;so lasting is the influence of the lessons of
youth.</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw did not mention that in the interval between the
two interviews he had called upon Mr. Purvis in the Square. The
ex-mayor had refused to commit himself to any course of action.</p>
<p class="par">Challis forgot the rectory and all that it connoted
before he was well outside the rectory&rsquo;s front door. Challis had
a task before him that he regarded with the utmost distaste. He had
warmly championed a cause; he had been heated by the presentation of a
manifest injustice which was none the less tyrannical because it was
ridiculous. But now he realised that it was only the abstract question
which had aroused his enthusiastic advocacy, and he shrank from the
interview with Victor Stott&mdash;that small, deliberate, intimidating
child.</p>
<p class="par">Henry Challis, the savant, the man of repute in letters,
the respected figure in the larger world; Challis, the proprietor and
landlord; Challis, the power among known men, knew that he would have
to plead, to humble himself, to be prepared for a rebuff&mdash;worst of
all, to acknowledge the justice of taking so undignified a position.
Any aristocrat may stoop with dignity when he condescends of his own
free will; but there are few who can submit gracefully to deserved
contempt. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Challis was one of the few. He had many admirable
qualities. Nevertheless, during that short motor ride from Stoke to his
own house, he resented the indignity he anticipated, resented it
intensely&mdash;and submitted.</p>

<p class="par first">He was allowed no respite. Victor Stott was
emerging from the library window as Challis rolled up to the hall door.
It was one of Ellen Mary&rsquo;s days&mdash;she stood respectfully in
the background while her son descended; she curtsied to Challis as he
came forward.</p>
<p class="par">He hesitated a moment. He would not risk insult in the
presence of his chauffeur and Mrs. Stott. He confronted the Wonder; he
stood before him, and over him like a cliff.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I must speak to you for a moment on a matter of
some importance,&rdquo; said Challis to the little figure below him,
and as he spoke he looked over the child&rsquo;s head at the
child&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;It is a matter that concerns your own
welfare. Will you come into the house with me for a few
minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary nodded, and Challis understood. He turned and
led the way. At the door, however, he stood aside and spoke again to
Mrs. Stott. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in and have some tea, or
something?&rdquo; he asked. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href=
"#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir, thank you, sir,&rdquo; replied Ellen
Mary; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just wait &rsquo;ere till &rsquo;e&rsquo;s
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At least come in and sit down,&rdquo; said
Challis, and she came in and sat in the hall. The Wonder had already
preceded them into the house. He had walked into the
morning-room&mdash;probably because the door stood open, though he was
now tall enough to reach the handles of the Challis Court doors. He
stood in the middle of the room when Challis entered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; said
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder shook his head.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you are aware,&rdquo; began
Challis, &ldquo;that there is a system of education in England at the
present time, which requires that every child should attend school at
the age of five years, unless the parents are able to provide their
children with an education elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder nodded.</p>
<p class="par">Challis inferred that he need proffer no further
information with regard to the Education Act.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now, it is very absurd,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;and I have, myself, pointed out the absurdity; but there is a
man of some influence in this neighbourhood who insists that you should
attend the elementary school.&rdquo; He paused, but the Wonder gave no
sign.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have argued with this man,&rdquo; continued
Challis, &ldquo;and I have also seen another member of the Local
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>Education Authority&mdash;a man of some note in
the larger world&mdash;and it seems that you cannot be exempted unless
you convince the Authority that your knowledge is such that to give you
a Council school education would be the most absurd farce.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cannot you stand in loco parentis?&rdquo; asked
the Wonder suddenly, in his still, thin voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Challis, startled by this
outburst, &ldquo;that I am in a sense providing you with an education?
Quite true; but there is Crashaw to deal with.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Inform him,&rdquo; said the Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">Challis sighed. &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but he can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; And then, feeling the
urgent need to explain something of the motives that govern this little
world of ours&mdash;the world into which this strangely logical
exception had been born&mdash;Challis attempted an exposition.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that these things
must seem to you utterly absurd, but you must try to realise that you
are an exception to the world about you; that Crashaw or I, or, indeed,
the greatest minds of the present day, are not ruled by the fine logic
which you are able to exercise. We are children compared to you. We are
swayed even in the making of our laws by little primitive emotions and
passions, self-interests, desires. And at the best we are not capable
of ordering our lives and our government to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>those just ends which we may see, some of us,
are abstractly right and fine. We are at the mercy of that great mass
of the people who have not yet won to an intellectual and
discriminating judgment of how their own needs may best be served, and
whose representatives consider the interests of a party, a
constituency, and especially of their own personal ambitions and
welfare, before the needs of humanity as a whole, or even the humanity
of these little islands.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Above all, we are divided man against man. We are
split into parties and factions, by greed and jealousies, petty spites
and self-seeking, by unintelligence, by education, and by our
inability&mdash;a mental inability&mdash;&lsquo;to see life steadily
and see it whole,&rsquo; and lastly, perhaps chiefly, by our intense
egotisms, both physical and intellectual.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Try to realise this. It is necessary, because
whatever your wisdom, you have to live in a world of comparative
ignorance, a world which cannot appreciate you, but which can and will
fall back upon the compelling power of the savage&mdash;the resort to
physical, brute force.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder nodded. &ldquo;You
suggest&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Merely that you should consent to answer certain
elementary questions which the members of the Local Authority will put
to you,&rdquo; replied Challis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200"
href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>&ldquo;I can arrange that
these questions be asked here&mdash;in the library. Will you
consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder nodded, and made his way into the hall,
without another word. His mother rose and opened the front door for
him.</p>
<p class="par">As Challis watched the curious couple go down the drive,
he sighed again, perhaps with relief, perhaps at the impotence of the
world of men.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There were four striking figures on the Education
Committee selected by the Ailesworth County Council.</p>
<p class="par">The first of these was Sir Deane Elmer, who was also
chairman of the Council at this time. The second was the vice-chairman,
Enoch Purvis, the ex-mayor, commonly, if incorrectly, known as
&ldquo;Mayor&rdquo; Purvis.</p>
<p class="par">The third was Richard Standing, J.P., who owned much
property on the Quainton side of the town. He was a bluff, hearty man,
devoted to sport and agriculture; a Conservative by birth and
inclination, a staunch upholder of the Church and the Tariff Reform
movement.</p>
<p class="par">The fourth was the Rev. Philip Steven, a co-opted member
of the Committee, head master of the Ailesworth Grammar School. Steven
was a tall, thin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201"
name="pb201">201</a>]</span>man with bent shoulders, and he had a long,
thin face, the length of which was exaggerated by his square brown
beard. He wore gold-mounted spectacles which, owing to his habit of
dropping his head, always needed adjustment whenever he looked up. The
movement of lifting his head and raising his hand to his glasses had
become so closely associated, that his hand went up even when there was
no apparent need for the action. Steven spoke of himself as a Broad
Churchman, and in his speech on prize-day he never omitted some
allusion to the necessity for &ldquo;marching&rdquo; or &ldquo;keeping
step&rdquo; with the times. But Elmer was inclined to laugh at this
assumption of modernity. &ldquo;Steven,&rdquo; he said, on one
occasion, &ldquo;marks time and thinks he is keeping step. And every
now and then he runs a little to catch up.&rdquo; The point of
Elmer&rsquo;s satire lay in the fact that Steven was usually to be seen
either walking very slowly, head down, lost in abstraction;
or&mdash;when aroused to a sense of present necessity&mdash;going with
long strides as if intent on catching up with the times without further
delay. Very often, too, he might be seen running across the school
playground, his hand up to those elusive glasses of his. &ldquo;There
goes Mr. Steven, catching up with the times,&rdquo; had become an
accepted phrase.</p>
<p class="par">There were other members of the Education Committee,
notably Mrs. Philip Steven, but they were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>subordinate. If those
four striking figures were unanimous, no other member would have
dreamed of expressing a contrary opinion. But up to this time they had
not yet been agreed upon any important line of action.</p>
<p class="par">This four, Challis and Crashaw met in the morning-room
of Challis Court one Thursday afternoon in early June. Elmer had
brought a stenographer with him for scientific purposes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Challis, when they were all
assembled. &ldquo;The&mdash;the subject&mdash;I mean, Victor Stott is
in the library. Shall we adjourn?&rdquo; Challis had not felt so
nervous since the morning before he had sat for honours in the
Cambridge Senate House.</p>
<p class="par">In the library they found a small child, reading.</p>

<p class="par first">He did not look up when the procession entered,
nor did he remove his cricket cap. He was in his usual place at the
centre table.</p>
<p class="par">Challis found chairs for the Committee, and the members
ranged themselves round the opposite side of the table. Curiously, the
effect produced was that of a class brought up for a viva voce
examination, and when the Wonder raised his eyes and glanced
deliberately down the line of his judges, this effect <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>was
heightened. There was an audible fidgeting, a creak of chairs, an
indication of small embarrassments.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Her&mdash;um!&rdquo; Deane Elmer cleared his
throat with noisy vigour; looked at the Wonder, met his eyes and looked
hastily away again; &ldquo;Hm!&mdash;her&mdash;rum!&rdquo; he repeated,
and then he turned to Challis. &ldquo;So this little fellow has never
been to school?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">Challis frowned heavily. He looked exceedingly
uncomfortable and unhappy. He was conscious that he could take neither
side in this controversy&mdash;that he was in sympathy with no one of
the seven other persons who were seated in his library.</p>
<p class="par">He shook his head impatiently in answer to Sir Deane
Elmer&rsquo;s question, and the chairman turned to the Rev. Philip
Steven, who was gazing intently at the pattern of the carpet.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think, Steven,&rdquo; said Elmer, &ldquo;that
your large experience will probably prompt you to a more efficient
examination than we could conduct. Will you initiate the
inquiry?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Steven raised his head slightly, put a readjusting hand
up to his glasses, and then looked sternly at the Wonder over the top
of them. Even the sixth form quailed when the head master assumed this
expression, but the small child at the table was gazing out of the
window. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Doubtless Steven was slightly embarrassed by the
detachment of the examinee, and blundered. &ldquo;What is the square
root of 226?&rdquo; he asked&mdash;he probably intended to say 225.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;15&middot;03329&mdash;to five places,&rdquo;
replied the Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">Steven started. Neither he nor any other member of the
Committee was capable of checking that answer without resort to pencil
and paper.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; ejaculated Squire Standing.</p>
<p class="par">Elmer scratched the superabundance of his purple jowl,
and looked at Challis, who thrust his hands into his pockets and stared
at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw leaned forward and clasped his hands together.
He was biding his time.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mayor&rdquo; Purvis alone seemed unmoved.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that book he&rsquo;s got open in front of
him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May I see?&rdquo; interposed Challis hurriedly,
and he rose from his chair, picked up the book in question, glanced at
it for a moment, and then handed it to the grocer. The book was Van
Vloten&rsquo;s Dutch text and Latin translation of Spinoza&rsquo;s
Short Treatise.</p>
<p class="par">The grocer turned to the title-page.
&ldquo;Ad&mdash;beany&mdash;dick&mdash;ti&mdash;de&mdash;Spy&mdash;nozer,&rdquo;
he read aloud and then: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about, Mr.
Challis?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;German or something, I take
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In any case it has nothing to do with elementary
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>arithmetic,&rdquo; replied Challis curtly,
&ldquo;Mr. Steven will set your mind at ease on that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; murmured Steven.</p>
<p class="par">Grocer Purvis closed the book carefully and replaced it
on the desk. &ldquo;What does half a stone o&rsquo; loaf sugar at
two-three-farthings come to?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder shook his head. He did not understand the
grocer&rsquo;s phraseology.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is seven times two and three
quarters?&rdquo; translated Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;19&middot;25,&rdquo; answered the Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that in shillin&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
asked Purvis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;1&middot;60416.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wrong!&rdquo; returned the grocer
triumphantly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Er&mdash;excuse me, Mr. Purvis,&rdquo; interposed
Steven, &ldquo;I think not. The&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;examinee has
given the correct mathematical answer to five places of
decimals&mdash;that is, so far as I can check him mentally.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, it seems to me,&rdquo; persisted the
grocer, &ldquo;as he&rsquo;s gone a long way round to answer a simple
question what any fifth-standard child could do in his head. I&rsquo;ll
give him another.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cast it in another form,&rdquo; put in the
chairman. &ldquo;Give it as a multiplication sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Purvis tucked his fingers carefully into his waistcoat
pockets. &ldquo;I put the question, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>he
said, &ldquo;as it&rsquo;ll be put to the youngster when he has to tot
up a bill. That seems to be a sound and practical form for such
questions to be put in.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis sighed impatiently. &ldquo;I thought Mr. Steven
had been delegated to conduct the first part of the examination,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It seems to me that we are wasting a lot of
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elmer nodded. &ldquo;Will you go on, Mr. Steven?&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p class="par">Challis was ashamed for his compeers. &ldquo;What
children we are,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p class="par">Steven got to work again with various arithmetical
questions, which were answered instantly, and then he made a sudden
leap and asked: &ldquo;What is the binomial theorem?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A formula for writing down the coefficient of any
stated term in the expansion of any stated power of a given
binomial,&rdquo; replied the Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">Elmer blew out his cheeks and looked at Challis, but met
the gaze of Mr. Steven, who adjusted his glasses and said, &ldquo;I am
satisfied under this head.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all beyond me,&rdquo; remarked Squire
Standing frankly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think, Mr. Chairman, that we&rsquo;ve had
enough theoretical arithmetic,&rdquo; said Purvis. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a few practical questions I&rsquo;d like to put.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No more arithmetic, then,&rdquo; assented Elmer,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>Crashaw exchanged a glance of understanding with
the grocer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now, how old was our Lord when He began His
ministry?&rdquo; asked the grocer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Uncertain,&rdquo; replied the Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Purvis smiled. &ldquo;Any Sunday-school child knows
that!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; murmured
Crashaw.</p>
<p class="par">But Steven looked uncomfortable. &ldquo;Are you sure you
understand the purport of the answer, Mr. Purvis?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can there be any doubt about it?&rdquo; replied
the grocer. &ldquo;I asked how old our Lord was when He began His
ministry, and he&rdquo;&mdash;he made an indicative gesture with one
momentarily released hand towards the Wonder&mdash;&ldquo;and he says
he&rsquo;s &lsquo;uncertain.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interposed Challis impatiently,
&ldquo;he meant that the answer to your question was
uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; returned the grocer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always understood&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; interrupted Challis.
&ldquo;But what we have always understood does not always correspond to
the actual fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What did you intend by your answer?&rdquo; put in
Elmer quickly, addressing the Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The evidence rests mainly on <a class=
"biblink xd22e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%203:23">Luke&rsquo;s

&tau;&rho;&iota;&#8049;&kappa;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&alpha;</span></span>&rsquo;
is vague&mdash;it allows latitude in either direction. According to the
chronology of John&rsquo;s Gospel the age might have been about
thirty-two.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It says &lsquo;thirty&rsquo; in the Bible, and
that&rsquo;s good enough for me,&rdquo; said the grocer, and Crashaw
muttered &ldquo;Heresy, heresy,&rdquo; in an audible under tone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sounds very like blarsphemy to me,&rdquo; said
Purvis, &ldquo;like doubtin&rsquo; the word of God. I&rsquo;m for
sending him to school.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Deane Elmer had been regarding the face of the small
abstracted child with considerable interest. He put aside for the
moment the grocer&rsquo;s intimation of his voting tendency.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How many elements are known to chemists?&rdquo;
asked Elmer of the examinee.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Eighty-one well characterised; others have been
described,&rdquo; replied the Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Which has the greatest atomic weight?&rdquo;
asked Elmer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Uranium.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And that weight is?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On the oxygen basis of
16&mdash;238&middot;5.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Extraordinary powers of memory,&rdquo; muttered
Elmer, and there was silence for a moment, a silence broken by Squire
Standing, who, in a loud voice, asked suddenly and most irrelevantly,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your opinion of Tariff Reform?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;An empirical question that cannot be decided from
a theoretical basis,&rdquo; replied the Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">Elmer laughed out, a great shouting guffaw. &ldquo;Quite
right, quite right,&rdquo; he said, his cheeks shaking with mirth.
&ldquo;What have you to say to that, Standing?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I say that Tariff Reform&rsquo;s the only way to
save the country,&rdquo; replied Squire Standing, looking very red and
obstinate, &ldquo;and if this Government&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis rose to his feet. &ldquo;Oh! aren&rsquo;t you
all satisfied?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is this Committee here to argue
questions of present politics? What more evidence do you
need?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not satisfied,&rdquo; put in Purvis
resolutely, &ldquo;nor is the Rev. Mr. Crashaw, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He has no vote,&rdquo; said Challis.
&ldquo;Elmer, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think we may safely say that the child has
been, and is being, provided with an education elsewhere, and that he
need not therefore attend the elementary school,&rdquo; replied Elmer,
still chuckling.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, is that what
you put to the meeting?&rdquo; asked Purvis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is quite informal,&rdquo; replied Elmer.
&ldquo;Unless we are all agreed, the question must be put to the full
Committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shall we argue the point in the other
room?&rdquo; suggested Challis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210"
href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; said Elmer.
&ldquo;We can return, if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">And the four striking figures of the Education Committee
filed out, followed by Crashaw and the stenographer.</p>
<p class="par">Challis, coming last, paused at the door and looked
back.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder had returned to his study of Spinoza.</p>
<p class="par">Challis waved a hand to the unconscious figure. &ldquo;I
must join my fellow-children,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;or they
will be quarrelling.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">But when he joined his fellow-children, Challis
stood at the window of the morning-room, attending little to the buzz
of voices and the clatter of glasses which marked the relief from the
restraint of the examination-room. Even the stenographer was talking;
he had joined Crashaw and Purvis&mdash;a lemonade group; the other
three were drinking whisky. The division, however, is arbitrary, and in
no way significant.</p>
<p class="par">Challis caught a fragment of the conversation here and
there: a bull-roar from Elmer or Squire Standing; an occasional
blatancy from Purvis; a vibrant protest from Crashaw; a hesitating
tenor pronouncement from Steven. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211"
href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Extraordinary powers of memory.... It isn&rsquo;t
facts, but what they stand for that I.... Don&rsquo;t know his
Bible&mdash;that&rsquo;s good enough for me.... Heresy, heresy.... A
phenomenal memory, of course, quite phenomenal,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The simple exposition of each man&rsquo;s theme was
dogmatically asserted, and through it all Challis, standing alone,
hardly conscious of each individual utterance, was still conscious that
the spirits of those six men were united in one thing, had they but
known it. Each was endeavouring to circumscribe the powers of the child
they had just left&mdash;each was insistent on some limitation he chose
to regard as vital.</p>
<p class="par">They came to no decision that afternoon. The question as
to whether the Authority should prosecute or not had to be referred to
the Committee.</p>
<p class="par">At the last, Crashaw entered his protest and announced
once more that he would fight the point to the bitter end.</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw&rsquo;s religious hatred was not, perhaps,
altogether free from a sense of affronted dignity, but it was
nevertheless a force to be counted; and he had that obstinacy of the
bigot which has in the past contributed much fire and food to the pyre
of martyrdom. He had, too, a power of initiative within certain limits.
It is true that the bird on a free wing could avoid him with
contemptuous ease, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212"
name="pb212">212</a>]</span>but along his own path he was a terrifying
juggernaut. Crashaw, thus circumscribed, was a power, a moving
force.</p>
<p class="par">But now he was seeking to crush, not some paralysed
rabbit on the road, but an elusive spirit of swiftness which has no
name, but may be figured as the genius of modernity. The thing he
sought to obliterate ran ahead of him with a smiling facility and spat
rearwards a vaporous jet of ridicule.</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw might crush his clerical wideawake over his
frowning eyebrows, arm himself with a slightly dilapidated umbrella,
and seek with long, determined strides the members of the Local
Education Authority, but far ahead of him had run an intelligence that
represented the instructed common sense of modernity.</p>
<p class="par">It was for Crashaw to realise&mdash;as he never could
and never did realise&mdash;that he was no longer the dominant force of
progress; that he had been outstripped, left toiling and shouting vain
words on a road that had served its purpose, and though it still
remained and was used as a means of travel, was becoming year by year
more antiquated and despised.</p>
<p class="par">Crashaw toiled to the end, and no one knows how far his
personal purpose and spite were satisfied, but he could never impede
any more that elusive spirit of swiftness; it had run past him.

<p class="par first">Meanwhile a child of five&mdash;all unconscious
that he was being represented to various members of the Local Education
Authority as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; under the especial care and
tutelage of the greatest of local magnates&mdash;ran through a
well-kept index of the books in the library of Challis Court&mdash;an
index written clearly on cards that occupied a great nest of accessible
drawers; two cards with a full description to each book, alphabetically
arranged, one card under the title of the work and one under the
author&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p class="par">The child made no notes as he studied&mdash;he never
wrote a single line in all his life; but when a drawer of that
delightful index had been searched, he would walk here and there among
the three rooms at his disposal, and by the aid of the flight of framed
steps that ran smoothly on rubber-tyred wheels, he would take down now
and again some book or another until, returning to the table at last to
read, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>he sat in an enceinte of piled volumes that had
been collected round him.</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes he read a book from beginning to end, more
often he glanced through it, turning a dozen pages at a time, and then
pushed it on one side with a gesture displaying the contempt that was
not shown by any change of expression.</p>
<p class="par">On many afternoons the sombrely clad figure of a tall,
gaunt woman would stand at the open casement of a window in the larger
room, and keep a mystic vigil that sometimes lasted for hours. She kept
her gaze fixed on that strange little figure whenever it roved up and
down the suite of rooms or clambered the pyramid of brown steps that
might have made such a glorious plaything for any other child. And even
when her son was hidden behind the wall of volumes he had built, the
woman would still stare in his direction, but then her eyes seemed to
look inwards; at such times she appeared to be wrapped in an
introspective devotion.</p>
<p class="par">Very rarely, the heavy-shouldered figure of a man would
come to the doorway of the larger room, and also keep a silent
vigil&mdash;a man who would stand for some minutes with thoughtful eyes
and bent brows and then sigh, shake his head and move away, gently
closing the door behind him.</p>
<p class="par">There were few other interruptions to the silence of
that chapel-like library. Half a dozen times in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>the
first few months a fair-haired, rather supercilious young man came and
fetched away a few volumes; but even he evidenced an inclination to
walk on tip-toe, a tendency that mastered him whenever he forgot for a
moment his self-imposed r&ocirc;le of scorn....</p>
<p class="par">Outside, over the swelling undulations of rich grass the
sheep came back with close-cropped, ungainly bodies to a land that was
yellow with buttercups. But when one looked again, their wool hung
about them, and they were snatching at short turf that was covered at
the wood-side by a sprinkle of brown leaves. Then the sheep have gone,
and the wood is black with February rain, and again the unfolding of
the year is about us; a thickening of high twigs in the wood, a glint
of green on the blackthorn....</p>
<p class="par">Nearly three cycles of death and birth have run their
course, and then the strange little figure comes no more to the library
at Challis Court. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217"

<p class="par first">The circumstance that had intrigued me for so long
was determined with an abruptness only less remarkable than the
surprise of the onset. Two deaths within six months brought to me, the
first, a competence, the second, release from gall and bitterness. For
the first time in my life I was a free man. At forty one can still look
forward, and I put the past behind me and made plans for the future.
There was that book of mine still waiting to be written.</p>
<p class="par">It was wonderful how the detail of it all came back to
me&mdash;the plan of it, the thread of development, even the very
phrases that I had toyed with. The thought of the book brought back a
train of associations. There was a phrase I had coined as I had walked
out from Ailesworth to Stoke-Underhill; a chapter I had roughed out the
day I went to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>see Ginger Stott at Pym. It seemed to me that
the whole conception of the book was associated in some way with that
neighbourhood. I remembered at last that I had first thought of writing
it after my return from America, on the day that I had had that curious
experience with the child in the train. It occurred to me that by a
reversal of the process, I might regain many more of my original
thoughts; that by going to live, temporarily perhaps, in the
neighbourhood of Ailesworth, I might revive other associations.</p>
<p class="par">The picture of Pym presented itself to me very clearly.
I remembered that I had once thought that Pym was a place to which I
might retire one day in order to write the things I wished to write. I
decided to make the dream a reality, and I wrote to Mrs. Berridge at
the Wood Farm, asking her if she could let me have her rooms for the
spring, summer, and autumn.</p>

<p class="par first">I was all aglow with excitement on the morning
that I set out for the Hampden Hills. This was change, I thought,
freedom, adventure. This was the beginning of life, my real entry into
the joy of living.</p>
<p class="par">The world was alight with the fire of growth. May had
come with a clear sky and a torrent of green <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>was
flowing over field, hedge, and wood. I remember that I thanked
&ldquo;whatever gods there be,&rdquo; that one could live so richly in
the enjoyment of these things.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Farmer Bates met me at Great Hittenden Station.
His was the only available horse and cart at Pym, for the Berridges
were in a very small way, and it is doubtful if they could have made
both ends meet if Mrs. Berridge had not done so well by letting her two
spare rooms.</p>
<p class="par">I have a great admiration for Farmer Bates and Mrs.
Berridge. I regret intensely that they should both have been unhappily
married. If they had married each other they would undoubtedly have
made a success of life.</p>
<p class="par">Bates was a Cockney by birth, but always he had had an
ambition to take a farm, and after twenty years of work as a skilled
mechanic he had thrown up a well-paid job, and dared the uncertainties
which beset the English farmer. That venture was a constant bone of
strife between him and his wife. Mrs. Bates preferred the town. It has
always seemed to me that there was something fine about Bates and his
love for the land.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good growing weather, Mr. Bates,&rdquo; I said,
as I climbed up into the cart. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222"
href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t be sorry to see some more
rain,&rdquo; replied Bates, and damped my ardour for a moment.</p>
<p class="par">Just before we turned into the lane that leads up the
long hill to Pym, we passed a ramshackle cart, piled up with a curious
miscellany of ruinous furniture. A man was driving, and beside him sat
a slatternly woman and a repulsive-looking boy of ten or twelve years
old, with a great swollen head and an open, slobbering mouth.</p>
<p class="par">I was startled. I jumped to the conclusion that this was
the child I had seen in the train, the son of Ginger Stott.</p>
<p class="par">As we slowed down to the ascent of the long hill, I said
to Bates: &ldquo;Is that Stott&rsquo;s boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Bates looked at me curiously. &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Them&rsquo;s the &rsquo;Arrisons. &rsquo;Arrison&rsquo;s
dead now; he was a wrong &rsquo;un, couldn&rsquo;t make a job of it,
nohow. They used to live &rsquo;ere, five or six year ago, and now
&rsquo;er &rsquo;usband&rsquo;s dead, Mrs. &rsquo;Arrison&rsquo;s
coming back with the boy to live. Worse luck! We thought we was shut of
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s an
idiot, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;Orrible,&rdquo; replied Bates, shaking his
head, &ldquo;&rsquo;orrible; can&rsquo;t speak nor nothing; goes about
bleating and baa-ing like an old sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I looked round, but the ramshackle cart was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>hidden by the turn of the road. &ldquo;Does
Stott still live at Pym?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not Ginger,&rdquo; replied Bates. &ldquo;He lives
at Ailesworth. Mrs. Stott and &rsquo;er son lives here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s still alive then?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bates.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Intelligent child?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; replied Bates.
&ldquo;Book-learnin&rsquo; and such. They say &rsquo;e&rsquo;s read
every book in Mr. Challis&rsquo;s librairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does he go to school?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No. They let &rsquo;im off. Leastways Mr. Challis
did. They say the Reverend Crashaw, down at Stoke, was fair put out
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I thought that Bates emphasised the &ldquo;on dit&rdquo;
nature of his information rather markedly. &ldquo;What do you think of
him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t worry
my &rsquo;ead about him. I&rsquo;ve got too much to <i>do</i>.&rdquo;
And he went off into technicalities concerning the abundance of
charlock on the arable land of Pym. He called it &ldquo;garlic.&rdquo;
I saw that it was typical of Bates that he should have too much to
<i>do</i>. I reflected that his was the calling which begot
civilisation.</p>

<p class="par first">The best and surest route from Pym to the Wood
Farm is, appropriately, by way of the wood; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>in
wet weather the alternative of various cart tracks that wind among the
bracken and shrub of the Common, is preferable in many ways. May had
been very dry that year, however, and Farmer Bates chose the wood. The
leaves were still light on the beeches. I remember that as I tried to
pierce the vista of stems that dipped over the steep fall of the hill,
I promised myself many a romantic exploration of the unknown mysteries
beyond.</p>
<p class="par">Everything was so bright that afternoon that nothing, I
believe, could have depressed me. When I looked round the low, dark
room with its one window, a foot from the ground and two from the
ceiling, I only thought that I should be out-of-doors all the time. It
amused me that I could touch the ceiling with my head by standing on
tiptoe, and I laughed at the framed &ldquo;presentation plates&rdquo;
from old Christmas numbers on the walls. These things are merely
curious when the sun is shining and it is high May, and one is free to
do the desired work after twenty years in a galley.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At a quarter to eight that evening I saw the sun
set behind the hills. As I wandered reflectively down the lane that
goes towards Challis Court, a blackbird was singing ecstatically in a
high elm; here and there a rabbit popped out and sat up, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>picture of precocious curiosity. Nature seemed
to be standing in her doorway for a careless half-hour&rsquo;s gossip,
before putting up the shutters to bar the robbers who would soon be
about their work of the night.</p>
<p class="par">It was still quite light as I strolled back over the
Common, and I chose a path that took me through a little spinney of
ash, oak, and beech, treading carefully to avoid crushing the tender
crosiers of bracken that were just beginning to break their way through
the soil.</p>
<p class="par">As I emerged from the little clump of wood, I saw two
figures going away from me in the direction of Pym.</p>
<p class="par">One was that of a boy wearing a cricket-cap; he was
walking deliberately, his hands hanging at his sides; the other figure
was a taller boy, and he threw out his legs in a curious, undisciplined
way, as though he had little control over them. At first sight I
thought he was not sober.</p>
<p class="par">The two passed out of sight behind a clump of hawthorn,
but once I saw the smaller figure turn and face the other, and once he
made a repelling gesture with his hands.</p>
<p class="par">It occurred to me that the smaller boy was trying to
avoid his companion; that he was, in one sense, running away from him,
that he walked as one might walk away from some threatening
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>animal, deliberately&mdash;to simulate the
appearance of courage.</p>
<p class="par">I fancied the bigger boy was the idiot Harrison I had
seen that afternoon, and Farmer Bates&rsquo;s &ldquo;We hoped we were
shut of him,&rdquo; recurred to me. I wondered if the idiot were
dangerous or only a nuisance.</p>
<p class="par">I took the smaller boy to be one of the villagers&rsquo;
children. I noticed that his cricket-cap had a dark patch as though it
had been mended with some other material.</p>
<p class="par">The impression which I received from this trivial affair
was one of disappointment. The wood and the Common had been so deserted
by humanity, so given up to nature, that I felt the presence of the
idiot to be a most distasteful intrusion. &ldquo;If that horrible thing
is going to haunt the Common there will be no peace or decency,&rdquo;
was the idea that presented itself. &ldquo;I must send him off, the
brute,&rdquo; was the rider. But I disliked the thought of being
obliged to drive him away.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">VI</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The next morning I did not go on the Common; I was
anxious to avoid a meeting with the Harrison idiot. I had been debating
whether I should drive him away if I met him. Obviously I had no more
right on the Common than he had&mdash;on the other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>hand, he was a nuisance, and I did not see why I
should allow him to spoil all my pleasure in that ideal stretch of wild
land which pressed on three sides of the Wood Farm. It was a stupid
quandary of my own making; but I am afraid it was rather typical of my
mental attitude. I am prone to set myself tasks, such as this eviction
of the idiot from common ground, and equally prone to avoid them by a
process of procrastination.</p>
<p class="par">By way of evasion I walked over to Deane Hill and
surveyed the wonderful panorama of neat country that fills the basin
between the Hampden and the Quainton Hills. Seen from that height, it
has something the effect of a Dutch landscape, it all looks so
amazingly tidy. Away to the left I looked over Stoke-Underhill.
Ailesworth was a blur in the hollow, but I could distinguish the high
fence of the County Ground.</p>
<p class="par">I sat all the morning on Deane Hill, musing and smoking,
thinking of such things as Ginger Stott, and the match with Surrey. I
decided that I must certainly go and see Stott&rsquo;s queer son, the
phenomenon who had, they say, read all the books in Mr. Challis&rsquo;s
library. I wondered what sort of a library this Challis had, and who he
was. I had never heard of him before. I think I must have gone to sleep
for a time.</p>
<p class="par">When Mrs. Berridge came to clear away my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>dinner&mdash;I dined, without shame, at
half-past twelve&mdash;I detained her with conversation. Presently I
asked about little Stott.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a queer one, that&rsquo;s what he
is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berridge. She was a neat, comely little woman,
rather superior to her station, and it seemed to me, certainly superior
to her clod of a husband.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A great reader, Farmer Bates tells me,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Berridge passed that by. &ldquo;His mother&rsquo;s
in trouble about him this morning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
such a nice, respectable woman, and has all her milk and eggs and
butter off of us. She was here this morning while you were out, sir,
and, what I could make of it that &rsquo;Arrison boy had been chasing
her boy on the Common last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I said with sudden enlightenment.
&ldquo;I believe I saw them.&rdquo; At the back of my mind I was
struggling desperately with a vague remembrance. It may sound
incredible, but I had only the dimmest memory of my later experience of
the child. The train incident was still fresh in my mind, but I could
not remember what Stott had told me when I talked with him by the pond.
I seemed to have an impression that the child had some strange power of
keeping people at a distance; or was I mixing up reality with some
Scandinavian fairy tale?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very likely, sir,&rdquo; Mrs. Berridge went on.
&ldquo;What upset Mrs. Stott was that her boy&rsquo;s never
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>upset by anything&mdash;he has a curious way of
looking at you, sir, that makes you wish you wasn&rsquo;t there; but
from what Mrs. Stott says, this &rsquo;Arrison boy wasn&rsquo;t to be
drove off, anyhow, and her son came in quite flurried like. Mrs. Stott
seemed quite put out about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Doubtless I might have had more information from my
landlady, but I was struggling to reconstruct that old experience which
had slipped away from me, and I turned back to the book I had been
pretending to read. Mrs. Berridge was one of those unusual
women&mdash;for her station in life&mdash;who know when to be silent,
and she finished her clearing away without initiating any further
remarks.</p>
<p class="par">When she had finished I went out on to the Common and
looked for the pond where I had talked with Ginger Stott.</p>
<p class="par">I found it after a time, and then I began to gather up
the threads I had dropped.</p>
<p class="par">It all came back to me, little by little. I remembered
that talk I had had with him, his very gestures; I remembered how he
had spoken of habits, or the necessity for the lack of them, and that
took me back to the scene in the British Museum Reading-Room, and to my
theory. I was suddenly alive to that old interest again.</p>
<p class="par">I got up and walked eagerly in the direction of Mrs.
Stott&rsquo;s cottage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href=

<p class="par first">Victor Stott was in his eighth year when I met him
for the third time. I must have stayed longer than I imagined by the
pond on the Common, for Mrs. Stott and her son had had tea, and the boy
was preparing to go out. He stopped when he saw me coming; an
unprecedented mark of recognition, so I have since learned.</p>
<p class="par">As I saw him then, he made a remarkable, but not a
repulsively abnormal figure. His baldness struck one immediately, but
it did not give him a look of age. Then one noticed that his head was
unmistakably out of proportion to his body, yet the disproportion was
not nearly so marked as it had been in infancy. These two things were
conspicuous; the less salient peculiarities were observed later; the
curious little beaky nose that jutted out <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>at an unusual angle
from the face, the lips that were too straight and determined for a
child, the laxity of the limbs when the body was in
repose&mdash;lastly, the eyes.</p>
<p class="par">When I met Victor Stott on this, third, occasion, there
can be no doubt that he had lost something of his original power. This
may have been due to his long sojourn in the world of books, a sojourn
that had, perhaps, altered the strange individuality of his thought; or
it may have been due, in part at least, to his recent recognition of
the fact that the power of his gaze exercised no influence over
creatures such as the Harrison idiot. Nevertheless, though something of
the original force had abated, he still had an extraordinary, and, so
far as I can learn, altogether unprecedented power of enforcing his
will without word or gesture; and I may say here that in those rare
moments when Victor Stott looked me in the face, I seemed to see a rare
and wonderful personality peering out through his eyes. That was the
personality which had, no doubt, spoken to Challis and Lewes through
that long afternoon in the library of Challis Court. Normally one saw a
curious, unattractive, rather repulsive figure of a child; when he
looked at one with that rare look of intention, the man that lived
within that unattractive body was revealed, his insight, his
profundity, his unexampled wisdom. If we mark the difference
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=

intelligence, then surely this child was a very god among men.</p>

<p class="par first">Victor Stott did not look at me when I entered his
mother&rsquo;s cottage; I saw only the unattractive exterior of him,
and I blundered into an air of patronage.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is this your boy?&rdquo; I said, when I had
greeted her. &ldquo;I hear he is a great scholar.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Ellen Mary quietly. She
never boasted to strangers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember me, I suppose?&rdquo; I
went on, foolishly; trying, however, to speak as to an equal.
&ldquo;You were in petticoats the last time I saw you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder was standing by the window, his arms hanging
loosely at his sides; he looked out aslant up the lane; his profile was
turned towards me. He made no answer to my question.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh yes, sir, he remembers,&rdquo; replied Ellen
Mary. &ldquo;He never forgets anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I paused, uncomfortably. I was slightly huffed by the
boy&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have come to spend the summer here,&rdquo; I
said at last. &ldquo;I hope he will come to see me. I have brought a
good many books with me; perhaps he might care to read some of
them.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">I had to talk <i>at</i> the boy; there was no
alternative. Inwardly I was thinking that I had Kant&rsquo;s Critique
and Hegel&rsquo;s Phenomenology among my books. &ldquo;He may put on
airs of scholarship,&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;but I fancy that he will
find those two works rather above the level of his comprehension as
yet.&rdquo; I did not recognise the fact that it was I who was putting
on airs, not Victor Stott.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s given up reading the past six
weeks, sir,&rdquo; said Ellen Mary, &ldquo;but I daresay he will come
and see your books.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She spoke demurely, and she did not look at her son; I
received the impression that her statements were laid before him to
take up, reject, or pass unnoticed as he pleased.</p>
<p class="par">I was slightly exasperated. I turned to the Wonder.
&ldquo;Would you care to come?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p class="par">He nodded without looking at me, and walked out of the
cottage.</p>
<p class="par">I hesitated.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;ll go with you now, sir,&rdquo;
prompted Ellen Mary. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what &rsquo;e
means.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I followed the Wonder in a condition of suppressed
irritation. &ldquo;His mother might be able to interpret his
rudeness,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;but I would teach him to convey his
intentions more clearly. The child had been spoilt.&rdquo; <span class=

<p class="par first">The Wonder chose the road over the Common. I
should have gone by the wood, but when we came to the entrance of the
wood, he turned up on to the Common. He did not ask me which way I
preferred. Indeed, we neither of us spoke during the half-mile walk
that separated the Wood Farm from the last cottage in Pym.</p>
<p class="par">I was fuming inwardly. I had it in my mind at that time
to put the Wonder through some sort of an examination. I was making
plans to contribute towards his education, to send him to Oxford,
later. I had adumbrated a scheme to arouse interest in his case among
certain scholars and men of influence with whom I was slightly
acquainted. I had been very much engrossed with these plans as I had
made my way to the Stotts&rsquo; cottage. I was still somewhat exalted
in mind with my dreams of a vicarious brilliance. I had pictured the
Wonder&rsquo;s magnificent passage though the University; I had acted,
in thought, as the generous and kindly benefactor.... It had been a
grandiose dream, and the reality was so humiliating. Could I make this
mannerless child understand his possibilities? Had he any ambition?</p>
<p class="par">Thinking of these things, I had lagged behind as we
crossed the Common, and when I came to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>gate
of the farmyard, the Wonder was at the door of the house. He did not
wait for me, but walked straight into my sitting-room. When I entered,
I found him seated on the low window-sill, turning over the top layer
of books in the large case which had been opened, but not unpacked.
There was no place to put the books; in fact, I was proposing to have
some shelves put up, if Mrs. Berridge had no objection.</p>
<p class="par">I entered the room in a condition of warm indignation.
&ldquo;Cheek&rdquo; was the word that was in my mind. &ldquo;Confounded
cheek,&rdquo; I muttered. Nevertheless I did not interrupt the boy;
instead, I lit a cigarette, sat down and watched him.</p>
<p class="par">I was sceptical at first. I noted at once the sure touch
with which the boy handled my books, the practised hand that turned the
pages, the quick examination of title-page and the list of contents,
the occasional swift reference to the index, but I did not believe it
possible that any one could read so fast as he read when he did
condescend for a few moments to give his attention to a few consecutive
pages. &ldquo;Was it a pose?&rdquo; I thought, yet he was certainly an
adept in handling the books. I was puzzled, yet I was still
sceptical&mdash;the habit of experience was towards disbelief&mdash;a
boy of seven and a half could not possibly have the mental equipment to
skim all that philosophy.... <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href=
"#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">My books were being unpacked very quickly. Kant, Hegel,
Schelling, Fichte, Leibnitz, Nietzsche, Hume, Bradley, William James
had all been rejected and were piled on the floor, but he had hesitated
longer over Bergson&rsquo;s <i>Creative Evolution</i>. He really seemed
to be giving that some attention, though he read it&mdash;if he were
reading it&mdash;so fast that the hand which turned the pages hardly
rested between each movement.</p>
<p class="par">When Bergson was sent to join his predecessors, I
determined that I would get some word out of this strange child&mdash;I
had never yet heard him speak, not a single syllable. I determined to
brave all rebuffs. I was prepared for that.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I said, when Bergson was laid down.
&ldquo;Well! What do you make of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He turned and looked out of the window.</p>
<p class="par">I came and sat on the end of the table within a few feet
of him. From that position I, too, could see out of the window, and I
saw the figure of the Harrison idiot slouching over the farmyard
gate.</p>
<p class="par">A gust of impatience whirled over me. I caught up my
stick and went out quickly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; I said, as I came within
speaking distance of the idiot, &ldquo;get away from here. Out with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The idiot probably understood no word of what I said,
but like a dog he was quick to interpret my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>tone
and gesture. He made a revoltingly inhuman sound as he shambled away, a
kind of throaty yelp. I walked back to the house. I could not avoid the
feeling that I had been unnecessarily brutal.</p>
<p class="par">When I returned the Wonder was still staring out of the
window; but though I did not guess it then, the idiot had served my
purpose better than my determination. It was to the idiot that I owed
my subsequent knowledge of Victor Stott. The Wonder had found a use for
me. He was resigned to bear with my feeble mental development, because
I was strong enough to keep at bay that half-animal creature who
appeared to believe that Victor Stott was one of his own kind&mdash;the
only one he had ever met. The idiot in some unimaginable way had
inferred a likeness between himself and the Wonder&mdash;they both had
enormous heads&mdash;and the idiot was the only human being over whom
the Wonder was never able to exercise the least authority.</p>

<p class="par first">I went in and sat down again on the end of the
table. I was rather heated. I lit another cigarette and stared at the
Wonder, who was still looking out of the window.</p>
<p class="par">There was silence for a few seconds, and then he spoke
of his own initiative. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href=
"#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Illustrates the weakness of argument from history
and analogy,&rdquo; he said in a clear, small voice, addressing no one
in particular. &ldquo;Hegel&rsquo;s limitations are qualitatively those
of Harrison, who argues that I and he are similar in kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The proposition was so astounding that I could find no
answer immediately. If the statement had been made in boyish language I
should have laughed at it, but the phraseology impressed me.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve read Hegel, then?&rdquo; I asked
evasively.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Subtract the endeavour to demonstrate a
preconceived hypothesis from any known philosophy,&rdquo; continued the
Wonder, without heeding my question, &ldquo;and the remainder, the only
valuable material, is found to be distorted.&rdquo; He paused as if
waiting for my reply.</p>
<p class="par">How could one answer such propositions as these offhand?
I tried, however, to get at the gist of the sentence, and, as the
silence continued, I said with some hesitation: &ldquo;But it is
impossible, surely, to approach the work of writing, say a philosophy,
without some apprehension of the end in view?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Illogical,&rdquo; replied the Wonder, &ldquo;not
philosophy; a system of trial and error&mdash;to evaluate a complex
variable function.&rdquo; He paused a moment, and then glanced down at
the pile of books on the floor. &ldquo;More millions,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p class="par">I think he meant that more millions of books
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>might be written on this system without arriving
at an answer to the problem, but I admit that I am at a loss, that I
cannot interpret his remarks. I wrote them down within an hour or two
after they were uttered, but I may have made mistakes. The mathematical
metaphor is beyond me. I have no acquaintance with higher
mathematics.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder had a very expressionless face, but I thought
at this moment that he wore a look of sadness; and that look was one of
the factors which helped me to understand the unbridgeable gulf that
lay between his intellect and mine. I think it was at this moment that
I first began to change my opinion. I had been regarding him as an
unbearable little prig, but it flashed across me as I watched him now,
that his mind and my own might be so far differentiated that he was
unable to convey his thoughts to me. &ldquo;Was it possible,&rdquo; I
wondered, &ldquo;that he had been trying to talk down to my
level?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am afraid I don&rsquo;t quite follow
you,&rdquo; I said. I had intended to question him further, to urge him
to explain, but it came to me that it would be quite hopeless to go on.
How can one answer the unreasoning questions of a child? Here I was the
child, though a child of slightly advanced development. I could
appreciate that it was useless to persist in a futile &ldquo;Why,
why?&rdquo; when the answer could only be given in terms that I could
not comprehend. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240"
name="pb240">240</a>]</span>Therefore I hesitated, sighed, and then
with that obstinacy of vanity which creates an image of self-perfection
and refuses to relinquish it, I said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wish you could explain yourself; not on this
particular point of philosophy, but your life&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I
stopped, because I did not know how to phrase my demand. What was it,
after all, that I wanted to learn?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; said the
Wonder. &ldquo;There are no data.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I saw that he had accepted my request for explanation in
a much wider sense than I had intended, and I took him up on this.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you any hypothesis?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I cannot work on the system of trial and
error,&rdquo; replied the Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">Our conversation went no further this afternoon, for
Mrs. Berridge came in to lay the cloth. She looked askance, I thought,
at the figure on the window-sill, but she ventured no remark save to
ask if I was ready for my supper.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, oh! yes!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shall I lay for two, sir?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Berridge.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Will you stay and have supper?&rdquo; I said to
the Wonder, but he shook his head, got up and walked out of the room. I
watched him cross the farmyard and make his way over the Common.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; I said to Mrs. Berridge, when the
boy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>was out of sight, &ldquo;that child is what in
America they call &lsquo;the limit,&rsquo; Mrs. Berridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">My landlady put her lips together, shook her head, and
shivered slightly. &ldquo;He gives me the shudders,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p class="par first">I neither read nor wrote that evening. I forgot to
go out for a walk at sunset. I sat and pondered until it was time for
bed, and then I pondered myself to sleep. No vision came to me, and I
had no relevant dreams.</p>
<p class="par">The next morning at seven o&rsquo;clock I saw Mrs. Stott
come over the Common to fetch her milk from the farm. I waited until
her business was done, and then I went out and walked back with
her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I want to understand about your son,&rdquo; I
said by way of making an opening.</p>
<p class="par">She looked at me quickly. &ldquo;You know, &rsquo;e
&rsquo;ardly ever speaks to me, sir,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="par">I was staggered for a moment. &ldquo;But you understand
him?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In some ways, sir,&rdquo; was her answer.</p>
<p class="par">I recognised the direction of the limitation. &ldquo;Ah!
we none of us understand him in all ways,&rdquo; I said, with a touch
of patronage.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Ellen Mary. She evidently
agreed to that statement without qualification. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what is he going to do?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;When he grows up, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, sir. We must leave that to
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I accepted the rebuke more mildly than I should have
done on the previous day. &ldquo;He never speaks of his future?&rdquo;
I said feebly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There seemed to be nothing more to say. We had only gone
a couple of hundred yards, but I paused in my walk. I thought I might
as well go back and get my breakfast. But Mrs. Stott looked at me as
though she had something more to say. We stood facing each other on the
cart track.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I suppose I can&rsquo;t be of any use?&rdquo; I
asked vaguely.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary broke suddenly into volubility.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I &rsquo;ope I&rsquo;m not askin&rsquo; too much,
sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but there is a way you could &rsquo;elp if
you would. &rsquo;E &rsquo;ardly ever speaks to me, as I&rsquo;ve said,
but I&rsquo;ve been opset about that &rsquo;Arrison boy.
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s a brute beast, sir, if you know what I mean, and
<i>&rsquo;e</i><span class="corr" id="xd22e4003" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> (she differentiated her pronouns only by
accent, and where there is any doubt I have used italics to indicate
that her son is referred to) &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t seem to &rsquo;ave
the same &rsquo;old on &rsquo;im as <i>&rsquo;e</i> does over others.
It&rsquo;s truth, I am not easy in my mind about it, sir, although
<i>&rsquo;e</i> &rsquo;as never said a word to me, not being afraid of
anything like other children, but &rsquo;e seems to have took
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>a sort of a fancy to you, sir&rdquo; (I think
this was intended as the subtlest flattery), &ldquo;and if you was to
go with &rsquo;im when &rsquo;e takes &rsquo;is
walks&mdash;&rsquo;e&rsquo;s much in the air, sir, and a great one for
walkin&rsquo;&mdash;I think &rsquo;e&rsquo;d be glad of your
cump&rsquo;ny, though maybe &rsquo;e won&rsquo;t never say it in so
many words. You mustn&rsquo;t mind &rsquo;im being silent, sir;
there&rsquo;s some things we can&rsquo;t understand, and though, as I
say, &rsquo;e &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t said anything to me, it&rsquo;s not
that I&rsquo;m scheming be&rsquo;ind &rsquo;is back, for I know
&rsquo;is meaning without words being necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She might have said more, but I interrupted her at this
point. &ldquo;Certainly, I will come and fetch him,&rdquo;&mdash;I
lapsed unconsciously into her system of denomination&mdash;&ldquo;this
morning, if you are sure he would like to come out with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure, sir,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;About nine o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That would do nicely, sir,&rdquo; she
answered.</p>
<p class="par">As I walked back to the farm I was thinking of the life
of those two occupants of the Stotts&rsquo; cottage. The mother who
watched her son in silence, studying his every look and action in order
to gather his meaning; who never asked her son a question nor expected
from him any statement of opinion; and the son wrapped always in that
profound speculation which seemed to be his only mood. What a
household! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=

<p class="par first">There is nothing to say of that first walk of mine
with the Wonder. I spoke to him once or twice and he answered by
nodding his head; even this notice I now know to have been a special
mark of favour, a condescension to acknowledge his use for me as a
guardian. He did not speak at all on this occasion.</p>
<p class="par">I did not call for him in the afternoon; I had made
other plans. I wanted to see the man Challis, whose library had been at
the disposal of this phenomenal child. Challis might be able to give me
further information. The truth of the matter is that I was in two minds
as to whether I would stay at Pym through the summer, as I had
originally intended. I was not in love with the prospect which the
sojourn now held out for me. If I were to be constituted head nursemaid
to Master Victor Stott, there would remain insufficient time for the
progress of my own book on certain aspects of the growth of the
philosophic method.</p>
<p class="par">I see now, when I look back, that I was not convinced at
that time, that I still doubted the Wonder&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>learning. I may have classed it as a freakish
pedantry, the result of a phenomenal memory.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Berridge had much information to impart on the
subject of Henry Challis. He was her husband&rsquo;s landlord, of
course, and his was a hallowed name, to be spoken with decency and
respect. I am afraid I shocked Mrs. Berridge at the outset by my casual
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this man Challis?&rdquo; She certainly atoned by her
own manner for my irreverence; she very obviously tried to impress me.
I professed submission, but was not intimidated, rather my curiosity
was aroused.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Berridge was not able to tell me the one thing I
most desired to know, whether the lord of Challis Court was in
residence; but it was not far to walk, and I set out about two
o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p class="par first">Challis was getting into his motor as I walked up
the drive. I hurried forward to catch him before the machine was
started. He saw me coming and paused on the doorstep.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did you want to see me?&rdquo; he asked, as I
came up.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mr. Challis?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you now,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;but perhaps <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246"
name="pb246">246</a>]</span>you could let me know some time when I
could see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, with the air of a man
who is constantly subjected to annoyance by strangers. &ldquo;But
perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind telling me what it is you wish to see
me about? I might be able to settle it now, at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am staying at the Wood Farm,&rdquo; I began.
&ldquo;I am interested in a very remarkable
child&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! take my advice, leave him alone,&rdquo;
interrupted Challis quickly.</p>
<p class="par">I suppose I looked my amazement, for Challis laughed.
&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of course you won&rsquo;t take
such spontaneous advice as that. I&rsquo;m in no hurry. Come in.&rdquo;
He took off his heavy overcoat and threw it into the tonneau.
&ldquo;Come round again in an hour,&rdquo; he said to the
chauffeur.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; I protested,
&ldquo;I could come quite well at any other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in no hurry,&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;You had better come to the scene of Victor Stott&rsquo;s
operations. He hasn&rsquo;t been here for six weeks, by the way. Can
you throw any light on his absence?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I made a friend that afternoon. When the car came back
at four o&rsquo;clock, Challis sent it away again. &ldquo;I shall
probably stay down here to-night,&rdquo; he said to the butler, and to
me: &ldquo;Can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>you stay to dinner? I must convince you about
this child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have dined once to-day,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;At half-past twelve. I have no other excuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! well,&rdquo; said Challis, &ldquo;you
needn&rsquo;t eat, but I must. Get us something, Heathcote,&rdquo; he
said to the butler, &ldquo;and bring tea here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Much of our conversation after dinner was not relevant
to the subject of the Wonder; we drifted into a long argument upon
human origins which has no place here. But by that time I had been very
well informed as to all the essential facts of the Wonder&rsquo;s
childhood, of his entry into the world of books, of his earlier
methods, and of the significance of that long speech in the library.
But at that point Challis became reserved. He would give me no
details.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You must forgive me; I can&rsquo;t go into
that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But it is so incomparably important,&rdquo; I
protested.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That may be, but you must not question me. The
truth of the matter is that I have a very confused memory of what the
boy said, and the little I might remember, I prefer to leave
undisturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He piqued my curiosity, but I did not press him. It was
so evident that he did not wish to speak on that head. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">He walked up with me to the farm at ten o&rsquo;clock
and came into my room.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We need not keep you out of bed, Mrs.
Berridge,&rdquo; he said to my flustered landlady. &ldquo;I daresay we
shall be up till all hours. We promise to see that the house is locked
up.&rdquo; Mr. Berridge stood a figure of subservience in the
background.</p>
<p class="par">My books were still heaped on the floor. Challis sat
down on the window-sill and looked over some of them. &ldquo;Many of
these Master Stott probably read in my library&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;in German. Language is no bar to him. He learns a language as
you or I would learn a page of history.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Later on, I remember that we came down to essentials.
&ldquo;I must try and understand something of this child&rsquo;s
capacities,&rdquo; I said in answer to a hint of Challis&rsquo;s that I
should leave the Wonder alone. &ldquo;It seems to me that here we have
something which is of the first importance, of greater importance,
indeed, than anything else in the history of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t make him speak,&rdquo; said
Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall try,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I recognise
that we cannot compel him, but I have a certain hold over him. I see
from what you have told me that he has treated me with most unusual
courtesy. I assure you that several times when I spoke to him this
morning he nodded his head.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249"
href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A good beginning,&rdquo; laughed Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; I went on,
&ldquo;how it is that you are not more interested. It seems to me that
this child knows many things which we have been patiently attempting to
discover since the dawn of civilisation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;I admit that,
but ... well, I don&rsquo;t think I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this key to all
knowledge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We are not ready for it,&rdquo; replied Challis.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t teach metaphysics to children.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Nevertheless my ardour was increased, not abated, by my
long talk with Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall go on,&rdquo; I said, as I went out to
the farm gate with him at half-past two in the morning.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I shall come
over and see you when I come back.&rdquo; He had told me earlier that
he was going abroad for some months.</p>
<p class="par">We hesitated a moment by the gate, and instinctively we
both looked up at the vault of the sky and the glimmering dust of
stars.</p>
<p class="par">The same thought was probably in both our minds, the
thought of the insignificance of this little system that revolves round
one of the lesser lights of the Milky Way, but that thought was not to
be expressed save by some banality, and we did not speak. <span class=

<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall certainly look you up when I come
back,&rdquo; said Challis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes; I hope you will,&rdquo; I said lamely.</p>
<p class="par">I watched the loom of his figure against the vague
background till I could distinguish it no longer. <span class=

<p class="par first">The memory of last summer is presented to me now
as a series of pictures, some brilliant, others vague, others again so
uncertain that I cannot be sure how far they are true memories of
actual occurrences, and how far they are interwoven with my thoughts
and dreams. I have, for instance, a recollection of standing on Deane
Hill and looking down over the wide panorama of rural England, through
a driving mist of fine rain. This might well be counted among true
memories, were it not for the fact that clearly associated with the
picture is an image of myself grown to enormous dimensions, a Brocken
spectre that threatened the world with titanic gestures of
denouncement, and I seem to remember that this figure was saying:
&ldquo;All life runs through my fingers like a handful of dry
sand.&rdquo; And yet the remembrance has not the quality of a dream.

<p class="par">I was, undoubtedly, overwrought at times. There were
days when the sight of a book filled me with physical nausea, with
contempt for the littleness, the narrow outlook, that seemed to me to
characterise every written work. I was fiercely, but quite impotently,
eager at such times to demonstrate the futility of all the philosophy
ranged on the rough wooden shelves in my gloomy sitting-room. I would
walk up and down and gesticulate, struggling, fighting to make clear to
myself what a true philosophy should set forth. I felt at such times
that all the knowledge I needed for so stupendous a task was present
with me in some inexplicable way, was even pressing upon me, but that
my brain was so clogged and heavy that not one idea of all that
priceless wisdom could be expressed in clear thought. &ldquo;I have
never been taught to think,&rdquo; I would complain, &ldquo;I have
never perfected the machinery of thought,&rdquo; and then some dictum
thrown out haphazard by the Wonder&mdash;his conception of light
conversation&mdash;would recur to me, and I would realise that however
well I had been trained, my limitations would remain, that I was an
undeveloped animal, only one stage higher than a totem-fearing savage,
a creature of small possibilities, incapable of dealing with great
problems.</p>
<p class="par">Once the Wonder said to me, in a rare moment of lucid
condescension to my feeble intellect, &ldquo;You <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>figure space as a void in three dimensions, and
time as a line that runs across it, and all other conceptions you
relegate to that measure.&rdquo; He implied that this was a cumbrous
machinery which had no relation to reality, and could define nothing.
He told me that his idea of force, for example, was a pure abstraction,
for which there was no figure in my mental outfit.</p>
<p class="par">Such pronouncements as these left me struggling like a
drowning man in deep water. I felt that it <i>must</i> be possible for
me to come to the surface, but I could do nothing but flounder; beat
fiercely with limbs that were so powerful and yet so utterly useless. I
saw that my very metaphors symbolised my feebleness; I had no terms for
my own mental condition; I was forced to resort to some inapplicable
physical analogy.</p>
<p class="par">These fits of revolt against the limitations of human
thought grew more frequent as the summer progressed. Day after day my
self-sufficiency and conceit were being crushed out of me. I was always
in the society of a boy of seven whom I was forced to regard as
immeasurably my intellectual superior. There was no department of
useful knowledge in which I could compete with him. Compete indeed! I
might as well speak of a third-standard child competing with Macaulay
in a general knowledge paper. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Useful</i> knowledge,&rdquo; I have written,
but the phrase needs definition. I might have taught the Wonder many
things, no doubt; the habits of men in great cities, the aspects of
foreign countries, or the subtleties of cricket; but when I was with
him I felt&mdash;and my feelings must have been typical&mdash;that such
things as these were of no account.</p>
<p class="par">Towards the end of the summer, the occasions upon which
I was able to stimulate myself into a condition of bearable complacency
were very rare. I often thought of Challis&rsquo;s advice to leave the
Wonder alone. I should have gone away if I had been free, but Victor
Stott had a use for me, and I was powerless to disobey him. I feared
him, but he controlled me at his will. I feared him as I had once
feared an imaginary God, but I did not hate him.</p>
<p class="par">One curious little fragment of wisdom came to me as the
result of my experience&mdash;a useless fragment perhaps, but something
that has in one way altered my opinion of my fellow-men. I have learnt
that a measure of self-pride, of complacency, is essential to every
human being. I judge no man any more for displaying an overweening
vanity, rather do I envy him this representative mark of his humanity.
The Wonder was completely and quite inimitably devoid of any conceit,
and the word ambition had no meaning for him. It was inconceivable that
he should compare himself with any of his fellow-creatures,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>and it was inconceivable that any honour they
might have lavished upon him would have given him one moment&rsquo;s
pleasure. He was entirely alone among aliens who were unable to
comprehend him, aliens who could not flatter him, whose opinions were
valueless to him. He had no more common ground on which to air his
knowledge, no more grounds for comparison by which to achieve
self-conceit than a man might have in a world tenanted only by sheep.
From what I have heard him say on the subject of our slavery to
preconceptions, I think the metaphor of sheep is one which he might
have approved.</p>
<p class="par">But the result of all this, so far as I am concerned, is
a feeling of admiration for those men who are capable of such
magnificent approval for themselves, the causes they espouse, their
family, their country, and their species; it is an approval which I
fear I can never again attain in full measure.</p>
<p class="par">I have seen possibilities which have enforced a
humbleness that is not good for my happiness or conducive to my
development. Henceforward I will espouse the cause of vanity. It is
only the vain who deprecate vanity in others.</p>
<p class="par">But there were times in the early period of my
association with Victor Stott when I rebelled vigorously against his
complacent assumption of my ignorance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">May was a gloriously fine month, and we were much
out of doors. Unfortunately, except for one fortnight in August, that
was all the settled weather we had that summer.</p>
<p class="par">I remember sitting one afternoon staring at the same
pond that Ginger Stott had stared at when he told me that the boy now
beside me was a &ldquo;blarsted freak.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder had said nothing that day, but now he began
to enunciate some of his incomprehensible commonplaces in that thin,
clear voice of his. I wrote down what I could remember of his
utterances when I went home, but now I read them over again I am
exceedingly doubtful whether I reported him correctly. There is,
however, one dictum which seems clearly phrased, and when I recall the
scene, I remember trying to push the induction he had started. The
pronouncement, as I have it written, is as follows:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pure deduction from a single <span class="corr"
id="xd22e4190" title="Source: premiss">premise</span>, unaided by
previous knowledge of the functions of the terms used in the expansion
of the argument, is an act of creation, incontrovertible, and outside
the scope of human reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I believe he meant to say&mdash;but my notes are
horribly confused&mdash;that logic and philosophy were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>only
relative, being dependent always in a greater or less degree upon the
test of a material experiment for verification.</p>
<p class="par">Here, as always, I find the Wonder&rsquo;s
pronouncements very elusive. In one sense I see that what I have quoted
here is a self-evident proposition, but I have the feeling that behind
it there lies some gleam of wisdom which throws a faint light on the
profound problem of existence.</p>
<p class="par">I remember that in my own feeble way I tried to analyse
this statement, and for a time I thought I had grasped one significant
aspect of it. It seemed to me that the possibility of conceiving a
philosophy that was not dependent for verification upon material
experiment&mdash;that is to say, upon evidence afforded by the five
senses&mdash;indicates that there is something which is not matter; but
that since the development of such a philosophy is not possible to our
minds, we must argue that our dependence upon matter is so intimate
that it is almost impossible to conceive that we are actuated by any
impulse which does not arise out of a material complex.</p>
<p class="par">At the back of my mind there seemed to be a thought that
I could not focus, I trembled on the verge of some great revelation
that never came.</p>
<p class="par">Through my thoughts there ran a thread of reverence for
the intelligence that had started my <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>speculations. If only
he could speak in terms that I could understand.</p>
<p class="par">I looked round at the Wonder. He was, as usual,
apparently lost in abstraction, and quite unconscious of my regard.</p>
<p class="par">The wind was strong on the Common, and he sniffed once
or twice and then wiped his nose. He did not use a handkerchief.</p>
<p class="par">It came to me at the moment that he was no more than a
vulgar little village boy.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There were few incidents to mark the progress of
that summer. I marked the course of time by my own thoughts and
feelings, especially by my growing submission to the control of the
Wonder.</p>
<p class="par">It was curious to recall that I had once thought of
correcting the Wonder&rsquo;s manners, of administering, perhaps, a
smacking. That was a fault of ignorance. I had often erred in the same
way in other experiences of life, but I had not taken the lesson to
heart. I remember at school our &ldquo;head&rdquo; taking us&mdash;I
was in the lower fifth then&mdash;in Latin verse. He rebuked me for a
false quantity, and I, very cocksure, disputed the point and read my
line. The head pointed out very gravely that I had been misled by an
English analogy in my pronunciation <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>of the word
&ldquo;maritus,&rdquo; and I grew very hot and ashamed and apologetic.
I feel much the same now when I think of my early attitude towards the
Wonder. But this time, I think, I have profited by my experience.</p>
<p class="par">There is, however, one incident which in the light of
subsequent events it seems worth while to record.</p>
<p class="par">One afternoon in early July, when the sky had lifted
sufficiently for us to attempt some sort of a walk, we made our way
down through the sodden woods in the direction of Deane Hill.</p>
<p class="par">As we were emerging into the lane at the foot of the
slope, I saw the Harrison idiot lurking behind the trunk of a big
beech. This was only the third time I had seen him since I drove him
away from the farm, and on the two previous occasions he had not come
close to us.</p>
<p class="par">This time he had screwed up his courage to follow us. As
we climbed the lane I saw him slouching up the hedge-side behind
us.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder took no notice, and we continued our way in
silence.</p>
<p class="par">When we reached the prospect at the end of the hill,
where the ground falls away like a cliff and you have a
bird&rsquo;s-eye view of two counties, we sat down on the steps of the
monument erected in honour of those Hampdenshire men whose lives were
thrown away in the South-African war. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">That view always has a soothing effect upon me, and I
gave myself up to an ecstasy of contemplation and forgot, for a few
moments, the presence of the Wonder, and the fact that the idiot had
followed us.</p>
<p class="par">I was recalled to existence by the sound of a foolish,
conciliatory mumbling, and looked round to see the leering face of the
Harrison idiot ogling the Wonder from the corner of the plinth. The
Wonder was between me and the idiot, but he was apparently oblivious of
either of us.</p>
<p class="par">I was about to rise and drive the idiot away, but the
Wonder, still staring out at some distant horizon, said quietly,
&ldquo;Let him be.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I was astonished, but I sat still and awaited
events.</p>
<p class="par">The idiot behaved much as I have seen a very young and
nervous puppy behave.</p>
<p class="par">He came within a few feet of us, gurgling and crooning,
flapping his hands and waggling his great head; his uneasy eyes
wandered from the Wonder to me and back again, but it was plainly the
Wonder whom he wished to propitiate. Then he suddenly backed as if he
had dared too much, flopped on to the wet grass and regarded us both
with foolish, goggling eyes. For a few seconds he lay still, and then
he began to squirm along the ground towards us, a few inches at a time,
stopping every now and again to bleat and gurgle with that curious,
crooning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>note which he appeared to think would pacificate
the object of his overtures.</p>
<p class="par">I stood by, as it were, ready to obey the first hint
that the presence of this horrible creature was distasteful to the
Wonder, but he gave no sign.</p>
<p class="par">The idiot had come within five or six feet of us,
wriggling himself along the wet grass, before the Wonder looked at him.
The look when it came was one of those deliberate, intentional stares
which made one feel so contemptible and insignificant.</p>
<p class="par">The idiot evidently regarded this look as a sign of
encouragement. He knelt up, began to flap his hands and changed his
crooning note to a pleased, emphatic bleat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A-ba-ba,&rdquo; he blattered, and made uncouth
gestures, by which I think he meant to signify that he wanted the
Wonder to come and play with him.</p>
<p class="par">Still the Wonder gave no sign, but his gaze never
wavered, and though the idiot was plainly not intimidated, he never met
that gaze for more than a second or two. Nevertheless he came on,
walking now on his knees, and at last stretched out a hand to touch the
boy he so curiously desired for a playmate.</p>
<p class="par">That broke the spell. The Wonder drew back
quickly&mdash;he never allowed one to touch him&mdash;got up and
climbed two or three steps higher up the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>base of the monument.
&ldquo;Send him away,&rdquo; he said to me.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; I said threateningly to
the idiot, and at the sound of my voice and the gesture of my hand, he
blenched, yelped, rolled over away from me, and then got to his feet
and shambled off for several yards before stopping to regard us once
more with his pacificatory, disgusting ogle.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Send him away,&rdquo; repeated the Wonder, as I
hesitated, and I rose to my feet and pretended to pick up a stone.</p>
<p class="par">That was enough. The idiot yelped again and made off.
This time he did not stop, though he looked over his shoulder several
times as he lolloped away among the low gorse, to which look I replied
always with the threat of an imaginary stone.</p>
<p class="par">The Wonder made no comment on the incident as we walked
home. He had shown no sign of fear. It occurred to me that my
guardianship of him was merely a convenience, not a protection from any
danger.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">IV</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As time went on it became increasingly clear to me
that my chance of obtaining the Wonder&rsquo;s confidence was becoming
more and more remote.</p>
<p class="par">At first he had replied to my questions; usually, it is
true, by no more than an inclination of his head, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>but
he soon ceased to make even this acknowledgment of my presence.</p>
<p class="par">So I fell by degrees into a persistent habit of silence,
admitted my submission by obtruding neither remark nor question upon my
constant companion, and gave up my intention of using the Wonder as a
means to gratify my curiosity concerning the problem of existence.</p>
<p class="par">Once or twice I saw Crashaw at a distance. He
undoubtedly recognised the Wonder, and I think he would have liked to
come up and rebuke him&mdash;perhaps me, also; but probably he lacked
the courage. He would hover within sight of us for a few minutes,
scowling, and then stalk away. He gave me the impression of being a
dangerous man, a thwarted fanatic, brooding over his defeat. If I had
been Mrs. Stott, I should have feared the intrusion of Crashaw more
than the foolish overtures of the Harrison idiot. But there was, of
course, the Wonder&rsquo;s compelling power to be reckoned with, in the
case of Crashaw.</p>

<p class="par first">Challis came back in early September, and it was
he who first coaxed, and then goaded me into rebellion.</p>
<p class="par">Challis did not come too soon. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At the end of August I was seeing visions, not pleasant,
inspiriting visions, but the indefinite, perplexing shapes of
delirium.</p>
<p class="par">I think it must have been in August that I stood on
Deane Hill, through an afternoon of fine, driving rain, and had a
vision of myself playing tricks with the sands of life.</p>
<p class="par">I had begun to lose my hold on reality. Silence,
contemplation, a long-continued wrestle with the profound problems of
life, were combining to break up the intimacy of life and matter, and
my brain was not of the calibre to endure the strain.</p>
<p class="par">Challis saw at once what ailed me.</p>
<p class="par">He came up to the farm one morning at twelve
o&rsquo;clock. The date was, I believe, the twelfth of September. It
was a brooding, heavy morning, with half a gale of wind blowing from
the south-west, but it had not rained, and I was out with the Wonder
when Challis arrived.</p>
<p class="par">He waited for me and talked to the flattered Mrs.
Berridge, remonstrated kindly with her husband for his neglect of the
farm, and incidentally gave him a rebate on the rent.</p>
<p class="par">When I came in, he insisted that I should come to lunch
with him at Challis Court.</p>
<p class="par">I consented, but stipulated that I must be back at Pym
by three o&rsquo;clock to accompany the Wonder for his afternoon walk.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Challis looked at me curiously, but allowed the
stipulation.</p>
<p class="par">We hardly spoke as we walked down the hill&mdash;the
habit of silence had grown upon me, but after lunch Challis spoke out
his mind.</p>
<p class="par">On that occasion I hardly listened to him, but he came
up to the farm again after tea and marched me off to dinner at the
Court. I was strangely plastic when commanded, but when he suggested
that I should give up my walks with the Wonder, go away.... I smiled
and said &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; as though that ended the matter.</p>
<p class="par">Challis, however, persisted, and I suppose I was not too
far gone to listen to him. I remember his saying: &ldquo;That problem
is not for you or me or any man living to solve by introspection. Our
work is to add knowledge little by little, data here and there, for
future evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The phrase struck me, because the Wonder had once said
&ldquo;There are no data,&rdquo; when in the early days I had asked him
whether he could say definitely if there was any future existence
possible for us?</p>
<p class="par">Now Challis put it to me that our work was to find data,
that every little item of real knowledge added to the feeble store man
has accumulated in his few thousand years of life, was a step, the
greatest step any man could possibly make. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But could we not get, not a small but a very
important item, from Victor Stott?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Challis shook his head. &ldquo;He is too many thousands
of years ahead of us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can only bridge the gap
by many centuries of patient toil. If a revelation were made to us, we
should not understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So, by degrees, Challis&rsquo;s influence took
possession of me and roused me to self-assertion.</p>
<p class="par">One morning, half in dread, I stayed at home and read a
novel&mdash;no other reading could hold my attention&mdash;philosophy
had become nauseating.</p>
<p class="par">I expected to see the strange little figure of the
Wonder come across the Common, but he never came, nor did I receive any
reproach from Ellen Mary. I think she had forgotten her fear of the
Harrison idiot.</p>
<p class="par">Nevertheless, I did not give up my guardianship all at
once. Three times after that morning I took the Wonder for a walk. He
made no allusion to my defalcations. Indeed he never spoke. He
relinquished me as he had taken me up, without comment or any
expression of feeling.</p>

disturbed about her than about the non-appearance of the Wonder. He was
well able to take care of himself, but she.... How strange that with
all her calculations she had not thought of going to Challis Court, to
the place where her son had spent so many days. I began to question
whether the whole affair was not, in some way, a mysterious creation of
her own disordered brain.</p>
<p class="par">Nevertheless, I took upon myself to carry out that part
of the programme which I had not been allowed to state in words to Mrs.
Stott, and set out for Deane Hill. It was just possible that the Wonder
might have slipped down that steep incline and injured himself.
Possible, but very unlikely; the Wonder did not take the risks common
to boys of his age, he did not disport himself on dangerous slopes.</p>
<p class="par">As I walked I felt a sense of lightness, of relief from
depression. I had not been this way by myself since the end of August.
It was good to be alone and free.</p>
<p class="par">The day was fine and not cold, though the sun was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>hidden. I noticed that the woods showed scarcely
a mark of autumn decline.</p>
<p class="par">There was not a soul to be seen by the monument. I
scrambled down the slope and investigated the base of the hill and came
back another way through the woods. I saw no one. I stopped continually
and whistled loudly. If he is anywhere near at hand, I thought, and in
trouble, he will hear that and answer me. I did not call him by name. I
did not know what name to call. It would have seemed absurd to have
called &ldquo;Victor.&rdquo; No one ever addressed him by name.</p>
<p class="par">My return route brought me back to the south edge of the
Common, the point most remote from the farm. There I met a labourer
whom I knew by sight, a man named Hawke. He was carrying a stick, and
prodding with it foolishly among the furze and gorse bushes. The
bracken was already dying down.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this &rsquo;ere Master Stott,
sir,&rdquo; he said, looking up. &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s got loarst
seemingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I felt a sudden stab of self-reproach. I had been taking
things too easily. I looked at my watch. It was a quarter to four.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mr. Challis &rsquo;ave told me to look for
&rsquo;un,&rdquo; added the man, and continued his aimless prodding of
the gorse. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where is Mr. Challis?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s yonder, soomewheres.&rdquo; He
made a vague gesture in the direction of Pym.</p>
<p class="par">The sun had come out, and the Common was all aglow. I
hastened towards the village.</p>
<p class="par">On the way I met Farmer Bates and two or three
labourers. They, too, were beating among the gorse and brown bracken.
They told me that Mr. Challis was at the cottage and I hurried on. All
the neighbourhood, it seems, were searching for the Wonder. In the
village I saw three or four women standing with aprons over their
heads, talking together.</p>
<p class="par">I had never seen Pym so animated.</p>

<p class="par first">I met Challis in the lane. He was coming away from
Mrs. Stott&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you found him?&rdquo; I asked stupidly. I
knew quite well that the Wonder was not found, and yet I had a fond
hope that I might, nevertheless, be mistaken.</p>
<p class="par">Challis shook his head. &ldquo;There will be a mad woman
in that cottage if he doesn&rsquo;t come back by nightfall,&rdquo; he
remarked with a jerk of his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done what I can for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I explained that I had been over to Deane Hill,
searching and calling. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href=

<p class="par">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see anything?&rdquo; asked
Challis, echoing my foolish query of a moment before. I shook my
head.</p>
<p class="par">We were both agitated without doubt.</p>
<p class="par">We soon came up with Farmer Bates and his men. They
stopped and touched their hats when they saw us, and we put the same
silly question to them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t found him?&rdquo; We knew
perfectly well that they would have announced the fact at once if they
had found him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One of you go over to the Court and get any man
you can find to come and help,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;Tell
Heathcote to send every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">One of the labourers touched his cap again, and started
off at once with a lumbering trot.</p>
<p class="par">Challis and I walked on in silence, looking keenly about
us and stopping every now and then and calling. We called &ldquo;Hallo!
Hallo-o!&rdquo; It was an improvement upon my whistle.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a little chap,&rdquo; muttered
Challis once; &ldquo;it would be so easy to miss him if he were
unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It struck me that the reference to the Wonder was hardly
sufficiently respectful. I had never thought of him as &ldquo;a little
chap.&rdquo; But Challis had not known him so intimately as I had.</p>
<p class="par">The shadows were fast creeping over the Common. At the
woodside it was already twilight. The whole <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>of
the western sky right up to the zenith was a finely shaded study in
brilliant orange and yellow. &ldquo;More rain,&rdquo; I thought
instinctively, and paused for a moment to watch the sunset. The black
distance stood clearly silhouetted against the sky. One could discern
the sharp outline of tiny trees on the distant horizon.</p>
<p class="par">We met Heathcote and several other men in the lane.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t be able to do much to-night,
sir,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be dark in &rsquo;alf an
hour, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, do what you can in half an hour,&rdquo;
replied Challis, and to me he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come back
with me. We&rsquo;ve done what we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I had a picture of him then as the magnate; I had hardly
thought of him in that light before. The arduous work of the search he
could delegate to his inferiors. Still, he had come out himself, and I
doubt not that he had been altogether charming to the bewildered,
distraught mother.</p>
<p class="par">I acquiesced in his suggestion. I was beginning to feel
very tired.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Heathcote was at the gate when we arrived at the
Court. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ave they found &rsquo;im, sir?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Challis.</p>

<p class="par first">As I walked back at ten o&rsquo;clock it was
raining steadily. I had refused the offer of a trap. I went through the
dark and sodden wood, and I lingered and listened. The persistent tap,
tap, tap of the rain on the leaves irritated me. How could one hear
while that noise was going on? There was no other sound. There was not
a breath of wind. Only that perpetual tap, tap, tap, patter, patter,
drip, tap, tap. It seemed as if it might go on through eternity....</p>
<p class="par">I went to the Stotts&rsquo; cottage, though I knew there
could be no news. Challis had given strict instructions that any news
should be brought to him immediately. If it was bad news it was to be
brought to him before the mother was told.</p>
<p class="par">There was a light burning in the cottage, and the door
was set wide open.</p>
<p class="par">I went up to the door but I did not go in.</p>
<p class="par">Ellen Mary was sitting in a high chair, her hands
clasped together, and she rocked continually to and fro. She made no
sound; she merely rocked herself with a steady, regular
persistence.</p>
<p class="par">She did not see me standing at the open door, and I
moved quietly away.</p>
<p class="par">As I walked over the Common&mdash;I avoided the wood
deliberately&mdash;I wondered what was the human <span class=

Mary had not reached that limit.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Berridge had not gone to bed, and there were some
visitors in the kitchen. I heard them talking. Mrs. Berridge came out
when I opened the front door.</p>

steady pat, patter, drip, of the rain on the beech leaves.</p>

long, wailing cry out on the Common. I got up and looked out of the
window, but I could see nothing. The rain was still falling, but there
was a blur of light that showed where the moon was shining behind the
clouds. The cry, if there had been a cry, was not repeated.</p>
<p class="par">I went back to bed and soon fell asleep again.</p>
<p class="par">I do not know whether I had been dreaming, but I woke

<p class="par first">The pond was very full.</p>
<p class="par">On the side from which we approached, the ground sloped
gradually, and the water was stretching out far beyond its accustomed
limits.</p>
<p class="par">On the farther side the gorse among the trunks of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=

the bank. On that side the bank was three or four feet high.</p>
<p class="par">We came to the edge of the pond, and one of the
labourers waded in a little way&mdash;the water was very shallow on
that side&mdash;but we could see nothing for the scum of weed, little
spangles of dirty green, and a mass of some other plant that had borne
a little white flower in the earlier part of the year&mdash;stuff like
dwarf hemlock.</p>
<p class="par">Under the farther bank, however, I saw one comparatively
clear space of black water.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go round,&rdquo; I said, and led the
way.</p>
<p class="par">There was a tiny path which twisted between the gorse
roots and came out at the edge of the farther bank by the stem of the
tallest ash. I had seen tiny village boys pretending to fish from this
point with a stick and a piece of string. There was a dead branch of
ash some five or six feet long, with the twigs partly twisted off; it
was lying among the bushes. I remembered that I had seen small boys
using this branch to clear away the surface weed. I picked it up and
took it with me.</p>
<p class="par">I wound one arm round the trunk of the ash, and peered
over into the water under the bank.</p>
<p class="par">I caught sight of something white under the water. I
could not see distinctly. I thought it was a piece of broken
ware&mdash;the bottom of a basin. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279"

and was going to probe the deeper water with it. Then I saw that the
dim white object was globular.</p>
<p class="par">The end of my stick was actually in the water. I
withdrew it quickly, and threw it behind me.</p>
<p class="par">My heart began to throb painfully.</p>
<p class="par">I turned my face away and leaned against the
ash-tree.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can you see anythin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked one of
the labourers who had come up behind me.</p>

the pond and pressed a way through the gorse.</p>

death.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">If there had been any traces of a struggle, I had not
noticed them when I came to the edge of the pond. There may have been
marks as if a foot had slipped. I was not thinking of evidence when I
looked into the water.</p>
<p class="par">There were marks enough when the police came to
investigate, but they were the marks made by a twelve-stone man in
hobnail boots, who had scrambled into, and out of, the pond. As the
inspector said, it was not worth while wasting any time in looking for
earlier traces of footsteps below those marks.</p>
<p class="par">Nor were there any signs of violence on the body. It was
in no way disfigured, save by the action of the water, in which it had
lain for eighteen hours.</p>
<p class="par">There was, indeed, only one point of any significance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>from the jury&rsquo;s point of view, and that
they put on one side, if they considered it at all; the body was
pressed into the mud.</p>
<p class="par">The Coroner asked a few questions about this fact.</p>
<p class="par">Was the mud very soft? Yes, very soft, liquid on
top.</p>
<p class="par">How was the body lying? Face downwards.</p>
<p class="par">What part of the body was deepest in the mud? The chest.
The witness said he had hard work to get the upper part of the body
released; the head was free, but the mud held the rest. &ldquo;The
mooad soocked like,&rdquo; was the expressive phrase of the
witness.</p>
<p class="par">The Coroner passed on to other things. Had any one a
spite against the child? and such futilities. Only once more did he
revert to that solitary significant fact. &ldquo;Would it be
possible,&rdquo; he asked of the abashed and self-conscious labourer,
&ldquo;would it be possible for the body to have worked its way down
into the soft mud as you have described it to have been
found?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We-el,&rdquo; said the witness,
&ldquo;&rsquo;twas in the stacky mooad, &rsquo;twas through the sarft
stoof.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But this soft mud would suck any solid body down,
would it not?&rdquo; persisted the Coroner.</p>
<p class="par">And the witness recalled the case of a duck that had
been sucked into the same soft pond mud the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=

to add that on that occasion the mud had not been under water.</p>

explanation.</p>

fall into the pond by accident.</p>
<p class="par">I should have known, even if that conclusive evidence
with regard to his being pushed into the mud had never come to
light.</p>
<p class="par">He may have stood by the ash-tree and looked into the
water, but he would never have fallen. He was too perfectly controlled;
and, with all his apparent abstraction, no one was ever more alive to
the detail of his surroundings. He and I have walked together perforce
in many slippery places, but I have never known him to fall or even
begin to lose his balance, whereas I have gone down many times.</p>
<p class="par">Yes; I know that he was pushed into the pond, and I know
that he was held down in the mud, most probably by the aid of that ash
stick I had held. But it was not for me to throw suspicion on any one
at that inquest, and I preferred to keep my <span class=

have done so, even if I had been in possession of stronger
evidence.</p>
<p class="par">I hope that it was the Harrison idiot who was to blame.
He was not dangerous in the ordinary sense, but he might quite well
have done the thing in play&mdash;as he understood it. Only I cannot
quite understand his pushing the body down after it fell. That seems to
argue vindictiveness&mdash;and a logic which I can hardly attribute to
the idiot. Still, who can tell what went on in the distorted mind of
that poor creature? He is reported to have rescued the dead body of a
rabbit from the undergrowth on one occasion, and to have blubbered when
he could not bring it back to life.</p>
<p class="par">There is but one other person who could have been
implicated, and I hesitate to name him in this place. Yet one remembers
what terrific acts of misapplied courage and ferocious brutality the
fanatics of history have been capable of performing when their creed
and their authority have been set at naught.</p>

<p class="par first">I saw the Wonder before he was buried.</p>
<p class="par">I went up into the little bedroom and looked at him in
his tiny coffin.</p>
<p class="par">I was no longer afraid of him. His power over me was
dissipated. He was no greater and no less than any other dead
thing.</p>
<p class="par">It was the same with every one. He had become

&ldquo;poor little fellows&rdquo; who had died an untimely death.</p>

<h2 class="main">EPILOGUE</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE USES OF MYSTERY</h2>
<p class="par first">Something Challis has told me; something I have
learned for myself; and there is something which has come to me from an
unknown source.</p>
<p class="par">But here again we are confronted with the original
difficulty&mdash;the difficulty that for some conceptions there is no
verbal figure.</p>
<p class="par">It is comprehensible, it is, indeed, obvious that the
deeper abstract speculation of the Wonder&rsquo;s thought cannot be set
out by any metaphor that would be understood by a lesser
intelligence.</p>
<p class="par">We see that many philosophers, whose utterances have
been recorded in human history&mdash;that record which floats like a
drop of oil on the limitless ocean of eternity&mdash;have been
confronted with this same difficulty, and have woven an intricate and
tedious design of words in their attempt to convey some single
conception&mdash;some conception which themselves could see but dimly
when disguised in the masquerade of language; some figure that as it
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>limned grew ever more confused beneath the
wrappings of metaphor, so that we who read can glimpse scarce a hint of
its original shape and likeness. We see, also, that the very
philosophers who caricatured their own eidolon, became intrigued with
the logical abstraction of words and were led away into a wilderness of
barren deduction&mdash;their one inspired vision of a stable premiss
distorted and at last forgotten.</p>
<p class="par">How then shall we hope to find words to adumbrate a
philosophy which starts by the assumption that we can have no
impression of reality until we have rid ourselves of the interposing
and utterly false concepts of space and time, which delimit the whole
world of human thought.</p>
<p class="par">I admit that one cannot even begin to do this thing;
within our present limitations our whole machinery of thought is built
of these two original concepts. They are the only gauges wherewith we
may measure every reality, every abstraction; wherewith we may give
outline to any image or process of the mind. Only when we endeavour to
grapple with that indeterminable mystery of consciousness can we
conceive, however dimly, some idea of a pure abstraction uninfluenced
by and independent of, those twin bases of our means of thought.</p>
<p class="par">Here it is that Challis has paused. Here he says
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>that we must wait, that no revelation can reveal
what we are incapable of understanding, that only by the slow process
of evolution can we attain to any understanding of the mystery we have
sought to solve by our futile and primitive hypotheses.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; I have pressed him, &ldquo;why
do you hesitate to speak of what you heard on that
afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">And once he answered me:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I glimpsed a finality,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
that appalled me. Don&rsquo;t you see that ignorance is the means of
our intellectual pleasure? It is the solving of the problem that brings
enjoyment&mdash;the solved problem has no further interest. So when all
is known, the stimulus for action ceases; when all is known there is
quiescence, nothingness. Perfect knowledge implies the peace of death,
implies the state of being one&mdash;our pleasures are derived from
action, from differences, from heterogeneity.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! pity the child,&rdquo; said Challis,
&ldquo;for whom there could be no mystery. Is not mystery the first and
greatest joy of life? Beyond the gate there is unexplored mystery for
us in our childhood. When that is explored, there are new and wonderful
possibilities beyond the hills, then beyond the seas, beyond the known
world, in the everyday chances and movements of the unknown life in
which we are circumstanced. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=
"#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Surely we should all perish through sheer
inanity, or die desperately by suicide if no mystery remained in the
world. Mystery takes a thousand beautiful shapes; it lurks even in the
handiwork of man, in a stone god, or in some mighty, intricate machine,
incomprehensibly deliberate and determined. The imagination endows the
man-made thing with consciousness and powers, whether of reservation or
aloofness; the similitude of meditation and profundity is wrought into
stone. Is there not source for mystery to the uninstructed in the great
machine registering the progress of its own achievement with each
solemn, recurrent beat of its metal pulse?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Behind all these things is the wonder of the
imagination that never approaches more nearly to the creation of a
hitherto unknown image than when it thus hesitates on the verge of
mystery.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is yet so much, so very much cause for
wondering speculation. Science gains ground so slowly. Slowly it has
outlined, however vaguely, the uncertainties of our origin so far as
this world is concerned, while the mystic has fought for his entrancing
fairy tales one by one.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The mystic still holds his enthralling belief in
the succession of peoples who have risen and died&mdash;the succeeding
world-races, red, black, yellow, and white, which have in turn
dominated this planet. Science <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293"
href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>with its hammer and chisel
may lay bare evidence, may collate material, date man&rsquo;s
appearance, call him the most recent of placental mammals, trace his
superstitions and his first conceptions of a god from the elemental
fears of the savage. But the mystic turns aside with an assumption of
superior knowledge; he waves away objective evidence; he has a
certainty impressed upon his mind.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The mystic is a power; he compels a multitude of
followers, because he offers an attraction greater than the facts of
science; he tells of a mystery profounder than any problem solved by
patient investigation, because his mystery is incomprehensible even by
himself; and in fear lest any should comprehend it, he disguises the
approach with an array of lesser mysteries, man-made; with
terminologies, symbologies and high talk of esotericism too fearful for
any save the initiate.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But we must preserve our mystic in some form
against the awful time when science shall have determined a limit; when
the long history of evolution shall be written in full, and every stage
of world-building shall be made plain. When the cycle of atomic dust to
atomic dust is demonstrated, and the detail of the life-process is
taught and understood, we shall have a fierce need for the mystic to
save us from the futility of a world we understand, to lie to us if
need be, to inspirit our material and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>regular minds with
some breath of delicious madness. We shall need the mystic then, or the
completeness of our knowledge will drive us at last to complete the
dusty circle in our eagerness to escape from a world we
understand....</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;See how man clings to his old and useless
traditions; see how he opposes at every step the awful force of
progress. At each stage he protests that the thing that is, is good, or
that the thing that was and has gone, was better. He despises new
knowledge and fondly clings to the belief that once men were greater
than they now are. He looks back to the more primitive, and endows it
with that mystery he cannot find in his own times. So have men ever
looked lingeringly behind them. It is an instinct, a great and
wonderful inheritance that postpones the moment of disillusionment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We are still mercifully surrounded with the
countless mysteries of every-day experience, all the evidences of the
unimaginable stimulus we call life. Would you take them away? Would you
resolve life into a disease of the ether&mdash;a disease of which you
and I, all life and all matter, are symptoms? Would you teach that to
the child, and explain to him that the wonder of life and growth is no
wonder, but a demonstrable result of impeded force, to be evaluated by
the application of an adequate formula? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You and I,&rdquo; said Challis, &ldquo;are
children in the infancy of the world. Let us to our play in the nursery
of our own times. The day will come, perhaps, when humanity shall have
grown and will have to take upon itself the heavy burden of knowledge.
But you need not fear that that will be in our day, nor in a thousand
years.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Meanwhile leave us our childish fancies, our
little imaginings, our hope&mdash;children that we are&mdash;of those
impossible mysteries beyond the hills ... beyond the hills.&rdquo;

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
